                <p>Council Reader uses AI to summarize Los Angeles City Council meetings.</p>

                <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
                <p>City Council meetings are public, but let's be honest: most people don't have 3+ hours to watch them. The decisions made in these meetings affect housing, transportation, public safety, and how our tax dollars are spent.</p>
                <p>Council Reader exists to make it easier to stay informed and hold our elected officials accountable. When you can see how your council member voted and what they said, you're better equipped to decide who deserves your vote.</p>

                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>Meeting data and agendas come from the city's official <a href="https://lacity.primegov.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PrimeGov portal</a>. Video transcripts are processed using AI to generate news-style summaries that highlight key votes, debates, and what it all means for LA residents.</p>
