**KEY DECISIONS**
- Approved appointment of Benny Tran to Board of Water and Power Commissioners (passed 2-0)
- Approved DWP's $1 billion water recycling project for San Fernando Valley (passed 2-0) - will create 300 construction jobs and 36 permanent positions, producing water for 1 million people by 2028
- Approved motion on maximum indoor temperature ordinance for rental housing with amendments requiring comprehensive grid analysis before implementation

**NOTABLE DISCUSSIONS**
- Public comment strongly supported indoor temperature limits for rentals, citing extreme heat as deadly climate disaster, while DWP representative requested technical review of electrical grid impacts
- Committee discussed enforcement challenges for proposed cashless retail ban, questioning whether Civil Rights Department has appropriate resources for what may be simple administrative violations
- Organic waste collection expansion concerns raised about infrastructure capacity at existing facilities

**BOTTOM LINE**
The major water infrastructure investment moves forward while the rental cooling ordinance faces delays for grid analysis. The cashless retail ban framework needs refinement on enforcement mechanisms before returning to committee.
