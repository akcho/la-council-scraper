**City Council Meeting - Dec 02, 2025**

**KEY DECISIONS**
- Approved fee waiver ordinance for Pacific Palisades fire rebuilding (Item 23) - passed 15-0
- Continued controversial Harbor City RV park appeal (Item 15) to December 3rd for closed session review after legal challenges
- Approved various amendments to rent stabilization and utility legislation (Item 22) with mixed votes

**NOTABLE DISCUSSIONS**
- Over 100 residents testified, mostly Pacific Palisades fire survivors requesting permit fee waivers for rebuilding homes, condos, and townhouses
- Harbor City residents opposed RV park project citing safety violations and inadequate infrastructure requirements
- Councilmember Jurado raised concerns about potential tenant displacement from rent stabilization changes

**BOTTOM LINE**
Fire survivors will get relief from costly rebuilding permits, while the contentious Harbor City RV park decision awaits closed-door legal review tomorrow. Residents should watch for the December 3rd continuation where the RV park's fate will be decided after council reviews litigation details.
