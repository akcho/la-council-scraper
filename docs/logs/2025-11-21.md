## 2025-11-21 - Restore PDF and video summaries from git history

**Changes:**
- Restored 471 PDF summaries from data/pdf_summaries/ (recovered from git commit a461256)
- Restored 7 video summaries from data/video_summaries/ (recovered from git commit a461256)
- Updated deploy.sh to properly handle git stash operations during branch switching
- Updated site index.html date to 2025-11-21
- Minor updates to 7 meeting HTML pages

**Files modified:**
- data/pdf_summaries/*.json (471 files restored)
- data/video_summaries/*.json (7 files restored)
- deploy.sh (added stash logic for cleaner branch switching)
- site/index.html (date update)
- site/meetings/*.html (7 meeting pages with minor formatting updates)

**Context:**
During initial deployment to councilreader.com and gh-pages setup, the PDF and video summary data directories were lost due to branch switching operations. Recovered these critical files from git history using `git checkout a461256 -- data/pdf_summaries data/video_summaries`. These summaries are essential for the council file detail pages and meeting summaries.

**Impact:**
Council file pages now have access to 170 PDF summaries (out of 194 total files). Meeting pages have access to video summaries for 7 recent meetings.

**Known issue:**
Deploy script may still need refinement - gitignored data directories can be lost during git operations in deployment flow. Current workaround is to ensure data is present before running deploy.sh.
