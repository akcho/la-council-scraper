## 2025-11-20 - Standardize heading capitalization to sentence case

**Time:** $(date +%H:%M:%S)

**Changes:**
- Updated all section headers to sentence case (first letter only capitalized)
- Changed section titles: "Scheduled hearings", "Completed hearings", "No hearings held (requires 10 votes)", "Closed sessions", "Public comments", etc.
- Updated page headers: "Meeting summary", "Recent meetings", "Council files", "Related documents", "Official recommendation", "Official title"
- Modified generate_site.py title improvement mappings to use sentence case and plural forms
- Updated templates/meeting.html and templates/index.html headings
- Updated generate_councilfile_pages.py to use sentence case in generated HTML
- Regenerated all 7 meeting pages, 194 council file pages, and index pages

**Files modified:**
- generate_site.py (section title mappings)
- generate_councilfile_pages.py (HTML generation with sentence case)
- templates/meeting.html (heading capitalization)
- templates/index.html (heading capitalization)
- All generated HTML pages (site/meetings/*.html, site/councilfiles/*.html, site/index.html)

**Reasoning:**
Sentence case headings are more scannable, feel less formal, and follow modern web design conventions while maintaining clarity.
