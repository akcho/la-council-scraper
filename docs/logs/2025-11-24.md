## Commit: Remove time from meeting date display

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-24

**Files changed:**
- `generate_site.py` - Modified date formatting function
- `data/agendas/agenda_17283.json` - Updated meeting datetime
- `site/index.html` - Regenerated with new date format
- `site/meetings/*.html` - Regenerated meeting pages (7 files)

**Summary:**
Simplified meeting date display by removing the time component. Previously dates showed "November 12, 2025 at 06:00 PM", now they show just "November 12, 2025". Also fixed meeting datetime for agenda 17283 from 6:00 PM to 10:00 AM and regenerated site files.

## Commit: Improve video summaries and add meeting page navigation

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-24

**Files changed:**
- `summarize_meeting.py` - Enhanced prompt to avoid "ceremonial" meta-commentary
- `generate_video_summaries.py` - Increased rate limit wait times (60s → 120s)
- `generate_site.py` - Fixed date parsing format for proper chronological sorting
- `templates/meeting.html` - Added breadcrumb navigation ("← All Meetings")
- `data/video_summaries/*.json` - Regenerated all 7 meeting summaries
- `site/meetings/*.html` - Regenerated with new summaries and breadcrumb
- `site/index.html` - Regenerated with proper date sorting

**Summary:**
1. **Improved summarization prompt**: Added explicit banned words list (ceremonial, routine, primarily, mostly) to prevent unhelpful meta-commentary about meeting format. Summaries now focus on policy decisions, public comment themes, and actionable information for residents.

2. **Added breadcrumb navigation**: Meeting pages now have "← All Meetings" link at the top to navigate back to the index page.

3. **Fixed date sorting**: Index page now properly sorts meetings from most recent to oldest. The date parsing format was mismatched with the actual output format.

4. **Rate limit handling**: Increased wait times between API calls to 120 seconds to avoid Anthropic rate limits when regenerating summaries.
