port of LA? We play, um, a rec league softball in the summer, and I'm on the team called the Knights of Soroka. And I play in the outfield. Okay How did you start working at the port? So I've been working at the port since 2013, and I actually started as a summer intern in human resources and I worked there for about three years before I was hired full time in the waterfront commercial real estate division, where I've been for the past five. What is your day like working at the port? Um, so my day is always vary at the port, but, um, typically I always check in with the different tenants. See if they have any service requests. I also work on event permits for big events like Conquer the Bridge. Uh, Cirque de Soleil, La Fleet Week. So I work on those typically in the summer months. And then I also work on new permits for new properties. So right now I'm working on a permit for a new restaurant that's going to be out here. So that's been a lot of fun. Okay Um, what hobbies do you enjoy doing in your free time? Um, I like playing slow pitch here at the port of La. I love going to the beach, and I actually just got a new puppy a few months ago, so I really like hanging out with my new puppy, Daisy. Last one, what kinds of challenges have you faced during your career? Um challenges. Well actually, for the past year, we've all been working at home due to Covid, so that's been a challenge. Uh, learning to work from a laptop versus being in an office has been a big challenge . And being able to check in with all of our tenants remotely over zoom and teams has been a lot more difficult than being able to just call them up and meet in person at the different sites throughout the port, and that's it. I'm Megan Sestic, and this has been my career report. For more information, follow us online on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram . Hello everyone, I'm Natalia Volvo and here's what's happening in LA. This week. Affordable housing is coming to Lincoln Heights Council member Eunice Hernandez joined the community for the groundbreaking of Grace villas. The development includes a mix of units that will become much needed homes in the neighborhood. I think. Right now, we're standing on a publicly owned parking lot in Lincoln Heights in Council District one. We are celebrating the groundbreaking for Grace villas, which is an affordable housing development that is long time in the making. Homes for families. Three bedrooms, two bedrooms and also some homes for transitional aged youth and for families with members that have developmental disabilities. And all of them will receive affordable rents and services that support whatever their needs are so that they can move forward with the lives that they dream of for themselves. So we're excited about it. I live in Highland Village and this organization called works about the apartment complex and the remodel. The whole apartments for the many to low income for low income rents. And I've been living there since they bought it like 20 years ago. So it's been a great experience for us. Welcome to the first district. Welcome to an Ladot lot that very shortly is going to be 48 units of affordable housing. It's good to be here surrounded by neighbors, partners and friends to celebrate the groundbreaking of Grace villas. We're here because we believe that everyone, no matter their income, age or ability, deserves a safe, dignified and affordable place to call home. Back in 2022, voters passed measure ULA, which is creating revenue to build affordable housing to keep people in their homes. And so this is just a demonstration and proof that when the voters asked for creating affordable housing , we can deliver on that. We literally completed the funding for this development on Friday and are ready to start construction in a week. But before we begin, we have a tradition of blessing the land, which will ultimately house 48 families and young people. Recognizing the peoples and communities who have preserved this place for us to use . You guys want to grab some dirt ? All right. When I count to three, you guys, you guys just toss it. Ready One, two. Three. Toss Perfect. All right. Great. Remembering justice. Ruth Bader Ginsburg as part of a public art project, the city's Department of Cultural Affairs unveiled a memorial to Ginsburg, who blazed a trail in advocating for women's rights. A special monument will celebrate her impact and legacy. Good morning, everyone. It is a true honor to join you for the unveiling of the Ruth Bader Ginsburg Memorial and to celebrate a vision that has been in the works for years now. We are in the community of Van Nuys, particularly at the Van Nuys Civic Center, and we are so excited because we were finally able to unveil our Ruth Bader Ginsburg monument. It's a project that is being added to the DCA archives, Department of Cultural Affairs, but it's a really great story of how, when our departments work together in public, private partnerships, we can make these beautiful things happen. So this is a very long term project. I've been working on it for six years, and one of the things that I did to create the monument was to speak to family members of justice Ginsburg. I spoke to Jane Ginsburg, her daughter, and she told me about her incredible callers. So Justice Ginsburg would wear these beautiful collars when she would wear her robes. And I was inspired by those collars to create the ceiling and the floor of the monument. I also researched a little bit about her going to Harvard Law School, and I was inspired by the benches at Harvard Law School to create the seating area inside of the monument. And finally, there is a door in the very back of the monument, which is slightly ajar, kind of reminding us of how much more work there is to do to open doors for young women and girls , but also how much work that Justice Ginsburg began to do for us to open those doors of possibility. We hope this monument will be an inspiration , especially to young women, to know that law and government are careers that they can aspire to. It was built next to the library, and that was purposeful because they wanted to link it to Ruth Bader Ginsburg's love of books, love of reading and writing. But also just to enjoy a really beautiful green space. This project is a gift to the city of Los Angeles, and it's collectively held by all of us here in the United States. And that was a very important part to me of the project that it actually changes history because it becomes a part of the public record. And I really hope that people who come to see the monument understand that it's their monument, it's our public monument, and that it's a gift for each and every member of the city of Los Angeles. To giving for Thanksgiving at the Hollenbeck Community Police Station, the Los Angeles Police Department joined my gathering place International to help community members with turkeys and more. During this holiday season. And we're here at Hollenbeck Station, we're partnering up with my gathering place International, where we're here giving out turkeys to the community who are in need. Yes well, we're from our gathering place, international. This is our fifth year to be here in Boyle Heights to do our Thanksgiving outreach. We call it unity in our community. And we love to give. We love to sow into people's lives. So it's a gathering from our church. We buy turkeys from our ministry. People donate and this year we bought 50 turkeys. But we didn't have enough. So we had to run out to the store and pick up 38 more turkeys and some gift cards. So this year people were lined up all the way to the street in the rain for hours. Some of them got here at 6 a.m, so we're thankful that we were able to meet a need. Thank you sir. God bless you. Happy Thanksgiving, happy Thanksgiving. Parece excelente porque pues dando un poquito mas a la comunidad con estos tiempos dificiles esta pasando y se les agradece a ellos para hacer esta este tipo de eventos. Verdad para ayudar a la gente de la comunidad. So we want to make sure that the community knows that the Los Angeles Police Department is aware that a lot of people are going through tough times right now. So we always welcome the community here. We like to foster relationships with our local churches. So that people feel more comfortable coming to us. Hopefully that also bridges the gap between the community and the police. We just want to remind everyone that behind every badge is a heart and our police station is open to everyone and anyone that is going through hard times and is in need of the police. Please come in and report whatever crime you need to report. You are encouraged to come in and speak with any of us or call 911. If needed. Thanksgiving in the city continues bringing community together. Council members Dennis Hernandez and Hugo Soto Martinez got into the spirit of the holiday by teaming up for a turkey giveaway, and the chance to connect with Angelenos. Today, we are here at the Dream Center, right in the heart of Silver Lake, in collaboration with my Companera Ianis Hernandez. We're giving out 9000 turkeys to Angelenos from Council District one, 13 and beyond to make sure that we can fill the gap of food disparity and lack of income for a lot of our families. What better thing to give families and something they can share with their entire families, like a big old turkey? A un programa maravilloso. Qué nos ayuda para Los alimentos ahorita en esta época, estamos de deficit no todo esta bien. Caro Entonces eso nos ayuda muchisimo para toda la familia. Thank you very much. You too God bless you. Thank you. It's a beautiful display of community. I really miss the days in which we had more community. It's been really hard to connect with people and this is a great opportunity for different sorts of people to connect and, you know, it's for a great cause. I see it as a great effort to come together, something that's much needed for a little more unity within the government. And within the city and the people in the city just showing that they care. They care that they they're paying attention. You know, the most important thing about doing something like this is that we are telling people that we care about them, that we care about, that they have a wonderful experience during this Thanksgiving. And of course, you know, this is how we also build community. So when the volunteers come in today, we struggle together. We fight together, we support families together. And it just builds solidarity across so many different spectrums of our city. It is our responsibility as council members to be the guardians of some of our most vulnerable community members here in the city of La. Today is an example of us stepping up to make sure that families have everything they need to have a wonderful holiday season, happy holidays shows that people care even in the moment where it's not a lot of that going on right now. So we do appreciate that and it shows that there's still a lot of love and still a lot of compassion and empathy out there that we need to make sure that we continue to support because folks are struggling and everything is really expensive, from rent to groceries.

With so much of life happening in the digital world, connection to the internet is a necessity. Council President Marquis Harris Dawson joined local groups and community members to celebrate new connectivity along Crenshaw . We're here on Crenshaw Boulevard in the Hyde Park neighborhood. We're celebrating this morning because we got live free 24 over seven Wi-Fi internet access to everybody that's along the Crenshaw corridor. So if you're between Hyde Park and Leimert Park, you can use the internet for free. That means if you're in a coffee shop, you can use it. If you're in a park, you can use it if you're on the train on the metro, you can use it anywhere you are in this community, you'll have free Wi-Fi. There's a lot of inequity in internet availability, and we really saw it during Covid when all your business had to be conducted online. What you saw is people gathering outside libraries or outside McDonald's, even though those places were closed, they kept their Wi-Fi going and eventually we started doing that at the parks. And so to have this community disconnect, it creates a gap. Well, the California Community Foundation is the community's foundation, and for us, providing digital equity to all of Angelenos is one of our most significant priorities. Now, if you live in this community, of which I'm one, I live not too far away from here. You'll be able to access Wi-Fi, but now also provides a quality lifeline to access to jobs, to education, to health care, in ways that all Angelenos deserve. So we found out about this program through destination Crenshaw. They approached us about this new community Wi-Fi program and asked us if we be interested in kind of being one of the first pilots for the program. And we were like, absolutely, that sounds amazing. Like especially being like a farmers market and an outdoor space with really no access to, like, electricity or anything. We're kind of like pack in, pack out. So just being able to kind of have the opportunity to test out what that would look like to have kind of free access on a weekly basis. And see how we could utilize that was something that we were really excited about. You know, today we live in a digital world, and the amount of information, the amount of access you have really depends on your connectivity as well. And so this is just another way for us to make sure that every resident has equal footing. In the city's Department of Rec and Parks, playlist is all about inclusivity in sport and empowering those with disabilities. They are teaching blind soccer, proving that being visually impaired is no barrier to staying active and taking part in a team sport. So today, the city of Los Angeles play L.A. and the United States Association of Blind Athletes are hosting our fourth clinic, where we are teaching blind and visually impaired children how to play the sport of blind soccer. Being active and healthy is a really important part of every child's life. And so for kids who are blind and visually impaired, there aren't a ton of opportunities for them to be active and be a part of a team sport. So it's a really great opportunity to be active, to learn a sport and also be around other kids who are just like them. We invite anyone in our community to participate in our programs. We also like to educate the community around us to ensure that we're bringing awareness and attention to how we can empower our youth with disabilities. I'm here working with play L.A. as a recreational coach, working on blind soccer for visually impaired individuals specifically. It's kind of like a two fold gain. You have the idea that you get to understand that you don't have to just sit in a corner by yourself and not be able to do anything because you have a disability, but in fact, because you have a disability, you get to participate in a very unique and individualized sport that's tailor made and designed for individuals like yourself. And the second benefit is the fact that you get to teach non-disabled individuals about the sport and how it works, and you can have them play blind soccer with you as well. So that way they can kind of relate and connect to you more. So it's more or less about getting disabled people out there in the field, getting them exercising and connecting with other disabled youth. Yet also getting it to where sighted and non-disabled individuals can relate and kind of connect to us individuals who have disabilities. Go star football. Queremos evitar a todos Los padres estén interesados y sus hijos. Qué tienen discapacidad visual pueden participar pueden ingresar en la pagina de la o USA. También de la federacion y van a encontrar diferentes lugares, donde pueden venir a practicar futbol y lo mas importante divertirse y saber. Qué pueden aprender en espanol y en inglés? También. The office of Council member Curren Price hosted its annual city employee appreciation luncheon. It's an opportunity for city workers from many departments to gather together and be thanked for all they do for Angelenos. We're here at our district office for Councilman Curren Price. We're having our city employee appreciation luncheon. We have every year. This is basically a thank you to all the city employees for them coming out, doing all the work they do in South L.A, keeping our district clean, keeping it safe, keeping it memorable for people to live, work and play here. So thank you to our city employees. I'm here to visit current prices, community events in support of all of the great things that current price is doing that is uplifting the community. We really appreciate them. That's why we're having this luncheon, because they do stuff like this. We care about the safety of the citizens we serve. We care about the community, and we're trying to clean it up every day. We're doing our best for our community . We are the city of Los Angeles and we serve its residents. I'm always improving myself to help the community because we enjoy working for the people. I think this is an amazing opportunity for the community to find appreciation, to know that they are appreciated and that they are loved. So whenever you see a city employee walking by, doing their job here and thank them, thank them for us, thank them for our councilors. Thank you for everything they do. For. I love my job and I love the City of Los Angeles. In this week's feature story, we head to Hermann Park, where the Department of Cultural Affairs supports art in the park. They began with the hope that more kids could become college graduates. Now the programs include intergenerational creativity and the popular community band. Art in the Park is a community based artist led arts organization. We are located in Hermann Park in the Arroyo Seco . We've been serving this community since 1997 through workshops and classes in art, music, dance. We also do readings and screenings. We really strive to be kind of like a space away from your home that you feel comfortable in. We've been working in partnership with the Department of Cultural Affairs since 1997. This partnership allows us to connect to community, amplify our programs and be supported by the cultural fabric of Los Angeles. Art in the Park is located in a building that was built in 1939 as a clubhouse for lawn bowlers . Bertha Sosa pioneered art in the park to be a space where youth could envision themselves going to college. There was a really, really low graduation rate in this area, and her main focus was she wanted kids to be able to envision a future in which they went to college. We have consistent programing throughout the week and on the weekends. We have a very robust Latin jazz program and community band. Both those programs are multigenerational and open to all ages and abilities. We have Creativity Club and Elder Guitar Class, which is for our elders in the neighborhood. All of these programs are free and open to the community. Now, the event that I get the most joy from putting on is the weekly community, band and community Arts, which is music happening in tandem with art, where everybody can come out and create art or make music and it's consistent so you can see your neighbors and community once a week because of how long we have been serving this community, we're able to see kids that have grown up within the programing, bring their children to the programing. We want to be a space that people feel comfortable with, that they keep coming back to, that they bring their kids back to. Art in the Park invites everybody to come down and participate in a class or a workshop or a film screening for more information, you can go to Art in the Park, LA org.

All items and general public comment. Yes sir. Go ahead. You have three minutes for the items and one minute for general. Okay. I'm going to start off with number one. Our fire department. Right. Like I, I feel we don't treat our fire department well enough. We don't fund them well enough. And when likeHAVE  THREE MINUTES FOR THE ITEMS AND  ONE FOR GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT. >> Speaker: OUR FIRE, THEY ARE  THROWN UNDER THE BUS WHEN IT'S  THE CITY THAT REALLY MAKES ALL  THE DECISIONS AND THE MAYOR AND  STUFF, AND THEN THEY GET. I'M HERE TO STAND UP FOR THE  FIRE DEPARTMENT. TELL YOU TO PLEASE FULL MAKE  SURE THAT THEY'RE FULLY FUNDED. IT'S NOT FAIR THAT THEY HAVE TO  BAKE GOODIES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE  ENDS MEET. IT'S TIME TO FUND THEM. YOU COULD FIND FUNDING IN OTHER  WAYS, RIGHT. AND LIKE SAY, LIKE THE ICE  RINK, WHY NOT HAVE DISNEY OR  THE THE OLYMPIC FUND THE ICE  RINK AND YEAH, AS FAR AS THE  LIGHTS FOR THE DODGER STADIUM,  YEAH. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA BUT  YOU KNOW, WHILE I HAVE THE  DODGERS PAID FOR IT? I THINK THEY CAN AFFORD IT. WE CAN'T, WE CAN'T EVEN PAY FOR  OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT. I KNOW SMOKING SCAN CANNOT CALL  IN AND VOICE, THE WHOLE ENTIRE  SMOKING SCAN CAN'T CALL IN AND  VOICE THEIR OPINION BUT IT'S  COMMON, I THINK THEY WOULD  AGREE TO THIS. THAT OTHER OTHER ENTITIES CAN  COME AND HELP PAY. THE DODGERS HAVE MONEY, THE  OLYMPICS HAVE MONEY. WHY ARE YOU ROBBING THE FIRE  DEPARTMENT TO PAY FOR AN ICE  RINK, THAT'S JUST MY QUESTION. AND AS FAR AS THE LIGHTING  ONES, YEAH, WE NEED LIGHTING. I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE IS ALL  OF THESE PROTESTS TO LIGHTING. I'VE HAD A COUPLE OF ACCIDENTS,  BECAUSE I CANNOT SEE AT NIGHT. PLEASE CONTINUE WITH THE  LIGHTING. NOW I FORGET, WHEN IT GETS TO  THE ONE MINUTE, IS THAT MY  PUBLIC COMMENT? YOU ALWAYS LISTEN, WHO IS NOT  LISTENING. I'M GOING TO TALK OFF TOPIC,  I'M GOING TO TALK ON NUMBER 35. >> City Attorney: SO ITEM 35 IS  REFERRED BACK TO COMMITTEE. >> Speaker: SO THIS MY PUBLIC  COMMENT TIME? >> City Attorney: YOU'RE STILL  ON? >> Speaker: I GET SO LOST. IT'S SO CONFUSING. >> City Attorney: GO AHEAD,  CONTINUE. >> Speaker: I WANT MY PUBLIC  COMMENT MINUTE. LIKE AM I STILL ON MY MINUTES. >> City Attorney: ARE YOU  MOVING TO GENERAL PUBLIC  COMMENT. THEN PLEASE FINISH YOUR MINUTES  ON THE ITEMS. >> Speaker: SOMETIMES DO YOU IT  ALTOGETHER AND SOMETIMES YOU  DON'T. I WISH YOU COULD GET MORE  SYSTEMATIC LIKE THA. I KNOW 35  YOU SAY WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT  BUT ANYTHING BY MR. LEE UNTIL I  GET MY APOLOGY HAS TO BE NO,  RIGHT MR. LEE? BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE  LIGHTING, I DON'T UNDERSTAND  WHY THERE IS PROTEST. CAN YOU PROVIDE LIGHTING? OKAY, LIKE INSTEAD OF ICE RINK,  I WOULD RATHER HAVE LIGHTING. INSTEAD OF A DODGER STADIUM,  LIGHTS GO UP ON CITY HALL, I  WOULD RATHER HAVE A FIRE  DEPARTMENT THAT IS IT FULLY  FUNDED. THE LITTLE THINGS IN LIFE. A FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT IS  FUNDED AND LIGHTS, YOU KNOW,  THOSE THINGS WILL BE VERY  HELPFUL. OKAY, I'LL JUST SWITCH TO  PUBLIC COMMENT. >> City Attorney: GENERAL  PUBLIC COMMENT, YOU HAVE ONE  MINUTE. >> Speaker: I WANT TO ASK  QUESTIONS ABOUT PARADE THAT  HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY. I WANT TO KNOW WHY SCIENTOLOGY  WITH THEIR BALLOON THAT FALLS  EVERY YEAR, EVEN THE BALLOON,  THEY DON'T STAND UP, WHY THEY  HAD LIKE 20 COPS SURROUNDING  THEM AS IF THEY'RE THE  PRESIDENT, AS IF THEY'RE  HIGH-LEVEL PERSONNEL? I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU'RE  SPENDING MONEY AND RESOURCES  LIKE THAT? HOW EXPENSIVE IS IT TO HAVE 20  OVERTIME COPS FOR HOW MANY  HOURS OF THIS PARADE THAT, YOU  KNOW, THAT YOU'RE WASTING ON IT. LIKE I WANT TO KNOW? DID THEY SAY THEY'RE UNDER  THREAT? I WANT YOU TO KNOW,  SCIENTOLOGY, THERE IS NOT BEEN  ONE INCIDENT OF ANY PROTESTERS  ASSAULTING ANY PERSON FROM  SCIENTOLOGY PEOPLE. BUT WE HAVE PROTESTERS ATTACKED  BY SCIENCETOLOGIST. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL  OF THIS POLICE PROTECTION, IT  SHOULD BE AGAINST ANYONE WHO  SPEAKS UP AGAINST SCIENTOLOGY. THEY'RE ALSO HARASSING PEOPLE  ONLINE. THANK YOU. >> City Attorney: NEXT SPEAKER. >> Speaker: MY NAME IS PAT  ASHLEY AND I'VE LIVED IN THE  PALISADES FOR 60 YEARS. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU MORE  THAN WHAT I HAVE EMAILED YOU,  WE NEED YOUR HELP. WE NEED THE MAXIMUM HELP OKAY. WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY  FINANCIALLY TO BUILD BACK TO  WHERE IT WAS. BUT GIVEN THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF  TIME AND I HOPE YOU DO READ  WHAT I HAVE SENT TO YOU T HAS  MY NUMBERS AND BREAK DOWN. AGAIN WITH THE SHORTER AMOUNT  OF TIME, I JUST WANT TO SAY  THANK YOU TO TRACI FOR GOING  ABOVE AND BEYOND.

WERE NEVER INCLUDED IN ANY  YEAR'S BUDGET AS EXPECTED  REVENUE SOURCE. PERMIT WAIVER IS KEY TO MY  FAMILY AND THOUSANDS MORE. PROPERTY TAXES FROM THE  PALISADES AND SUBSIDIZED  SERVICES THROUGHOUT L.A. NOW THERE IS DELAY IN  REBUILDING. THERE IS A GAP FOR ANY MIDDLE  INCOME, FAMILIES BETWEEN THEIR  INSURANCE PROCEEDS IF ANY AND  ACTUAL COSTS TO REBUILD. DON'T HAVE AN EXTRA 60 TO  100,000 FOR PERMIT FEES. SHOW COMPASSION, BE FAIR.

WHICH ITEM WOULD YOU TO? >> Speaker: GENERAL QUOMENT,  REGARDING 23. >> City Attorney: YOU HAVE A  MINUTE FOR GENERAL PUBLIC  COMMENT. >> Speaker: I'M KIM FEEDER AND  I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE  CASTLEMAR  ASSOCIATION AND WE  REPRESENT 25 MILLION IN TAX  REVENUE FOR THE CITY ANNUALLY. I WANT TO DISPEL THE MYTH THAT  ANYBODY IN PALISADES HAS THE  RICHES TO REBUILD THAT IS NOT  THE CASE, WE HAVE NUMEROUS  ELDERLY, WE HAVE NUMEROUS  PEOPLE ON FIXED INCOMES, WE  HAVE NUMEROUS PEOPLE THAT WERE  ALSO CANCELED FROM THEIR  INSURANCE AND WERE LUCKY TO GET  FAIR PLAN UNDERSHAOUSHD.

WE DID NOT BUY A LOT WHERE YOU  PAY ALL OF THESE FEES, WE WERE  BURNED DOWN BY A WILDFIRE THAT  WAS OUT OF CONTROL AND COULD  NOT BE STOPPED FROM OUR  FIREFIGHTERS. [APPLAUSE] >> City Attorney: GOOD MORNING,  WHICH ITEMS WOULD YOU LIKE TO  SPEAK TO? >> Speaker: GOOD MORNING,  GENERAL ON ITEM 23,  PLEASE. >> City Attorney: YOU HAVE A  MINUTE. >> Speaker: I'M LOUISE AND I'M  A NURSE, I HAVE A VERY YOUNG  CHILD AND OLDER HUSBAND WHO IS  SET TO RETIRE BUT HE CAN NOT  BECAUSE WE LOST EVERYTHIN IN  THE PALISADES FIRE.

SPEAKING OF WHICH WE'RE  UNDERINSURED AND EVEN WITH SBA  LOANS WE AND MANY OTHERS CAN  ONLY REBUILD BACK SMALLER THAN  WE HAD BEFORE. WITH THE CURRENT ELIGIBILITY  AND ANY AMENDMENT THAT'S ARE  MADE, PLEASE GET RID OF ANY  HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE IT  STOPS OR PUNISHES THE SMALL  BUNGALOW OWNERS FROM INCREASING  THEIR SETBACK. WE NEED TO GO IN AND OUT TO  HAVE MORE DEFENSIVE SPACE IN  THE PALISADES AND MORE  RESILIENT AREA FOR EVERY ONE. SO I TOOK THE DAY OFF TODAY TO  BEG YOU. >> City Attorney: SPEAKER, YOUR  TIME IS EXPIRED.OD MORNING, WHI  YOU LIKE TO SPEAK TO? >> Speaker: ALL AVAILABLE ITEMS  AND GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT. >> City Attorney: OKAY YOU HAVE  THREE MINUTES FOR THE ITEMS AND  ONE FOR GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT.

I'M SUSAN COLLINS AND FIRST  WOULD I LIKE TO THANK TRACI  PARK FOR HER ADVOCACY ON BEHALF  OF THE PEOPLE SHE SERVES. IF WE HAD A GOVERNMENT THAT  CARED FOR PEOPLE HALF AS IT  MUCH AS IT CARES FROM  MAXIMIZING PROFITS, HOME AND  LIVES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LOST. THE FACT THAT WE'RE HERE TO BEG  THIS COUNCIL TO WAIVE FEES ON  PROPERTIES WHICH DUE TO YOUR  NEGLIGENCE BURNED TO THE GROUND  BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN LOS  ANGELES. OUR CAO SAYS IT WILL CAUSE A  DEFICIT. BUT CAN WAVING THESE FEES CAUSE  A SHORTAGE IN THE GENERAL FUND  UNLESS MEMBERS OF THIS COUNCIL  KNEW THERE WOULD BE THIS LEVEL  OF DEMAND AHEAD OF TIME AND  ENCOUNTERED ON THOSE FEES. PROFITING FROM DEVASTATION IS  NOTHING NEW FOR POLITICS IN LOS  ANGELES. BUT I STILL STAND BEFORE YOU  TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY  REQUEST THAT JUST FOR TODAY,  JUST FOR TODAY--. >> City Attorney: CAN WE PAWS  HER TIME. >> Speaker: DO THE RIGHT THING. >> City Attorney: SPEAKER, I  BELIEVE THAT WAS WITH REGARD TO  ITEM 23, THAT'S YOUR GENERAL  PUBLIC COMMENT.

Council president and colleagues I just wanted to rise and say that while I will be supporting this, this measure, I couldn't help but notice, uh, the fee changes . And on one of them, on the patio, notice that it's being reduced by $2 from 287 to 285. Again, while I support this recommendation, ITO 285, AGAIN   SUPPORT THIS RECOMMENDATION, I  JUST WANTED TO BRING NOTICE  THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING  ON FILMING RELATED PERMITTING  ISSUES AND SO THERE WILL BE A  LOT MORE TO COME. BUT, A LOT TO COME IN ORDER TO  ADDRESS THE GROWING NEEDS THAT  WE'VE HAD IN THE ENTER  STATEMENT INDUSTRY, A 2 DOLLAR  CHANGE IN PERMITTING FEE DOES  NOT ADEQUATE LEA --ADEQUATELY   ADDRESS THE NEED BUT IT WILL BE  A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. >> Council President: OKAY, CLO  TABULATE THE VOTE. 1-5, AYES. ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S NEXT? >> Clerk: NEXT WOULD BE ITEM 15  AND THAT WAS CALLED SPECIAL BY  COUNCILMEMBER McOSKER, THERE IS  AN AMENDMENT McOSKER-PARK THAT  HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AND  CIRCULATED, SIR. >> Council President:  COUNCILMEMBER McOSKER. >> T. McOsker: THANK YOU VERY  MUCH, MR. PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. ITEM NUMBER 15, WE HAVE SEEN A  COUPLE OF TIMES. AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN IN  COMMITTEE. THE NARROW QUESTION, IF YOU  WILL BEFORE US, IS THIS A  PROJECT FOR WHICH THE APPLICANT  HAS APPLIED? THAT CAN BE APPROVED  MINISTERIALY ER-THE-COUNTER. AND I'VE ARTICULATED MANY  ARGUMENTS HAS A CREDIT A  C.U.P.IS REQUIRED. AND AS YOU KNOW, LAWYERS VERY  OFTEN ARGUE IN THE ALTERNATIVE,  SO I'M GOING TO LAY ALL THREE  OF THEM OUT AT LEAST BUT I WANT  TO FOCUS ON ONE TODAY, WHICH IS  THE SUBJECT OF THE AMENDING  MOTION. THE USE ITSELF, AN RV PARK, THE  DEFINITION OF THE USE ITSELF,  SAYS THAT THIS IS A FACILITY  THAT IS AUTHORIZED BY A  CONTINUAL USE PERMIT. --CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT. WE SHOULD BEGIN AND END RIGHT  THERE. THAT REQUIRES A C.U.P. I REALIZE THAT THERE IS A GREAT  DEAL OF ANGST AND DISCUSSION AS  TO WHY THAT IS NOT THE CASE,  COMING FROM OUR STAFF. SOMETIMES I THINK THEY OVER  ARGUE IT, BUT IF WE GO TO THE  SECTION THAT THEY RELY ON, NA  HAS BEEN RELIED ON BY THE  APPLICANT AND BY SOME MEMBERS  OF THE STAFF, YOU LOOK AT  SECTION 14.00 OF THE MUNICIPAL  CODE, IT'S TECHNICALLY A 7, AND  IT SAYS THAT AN RV PARK IS  PERMITTED BECAUSE IT'S A PUBLIC  BENEFIT, PUBLIC BENEFIT IS  NEVER DEFINED, ARTICULATED IN  THE CODE. BUT IT ALLOWS IT TO GO INTO IN  RESIDENTIAL ZONE ACCORD TO GO  SOME PEOPLE'S READING, BUT WHEN  ONE LOOKS AT THE SUBSECTION, IT  ALSO SAYS THAT IT HAS TO BE  LAWFULLY AUTHORIZED ON THE DATE  OF THAT ORDINANCE CHANGE, WHICH  ORDINANCE WAS ADOPTED WELL  BEFORE THE DEFINITION. SOMEHOW OUR STAFF READS THAT ON  THE CODE AS WELL, THERE IS A  LOT OF GYMNASTICS GOING ON  HERE, SO WE READ OUT OF THE  CODE, THE DEFINITION OF THE  USE, WE READ OUT FLT CODE, THE  REQUIREMENT THAT IT WOULD BE  ESTABLISHED WHICH RELATES BACK  TO THE DEFINITION. THOSE ARE TWO ARGUMENTS THAT IS  GOING TO SET ASIDE FOR A MINUTE. I WANT TO GO TO OUR STAFF  ARGUMENT. WHEN ONE LOOKS AT 14.00 A-7, IT  SAYS THAT IN A RESIDENTIAL ZONE  AND OTHER ZONES, IF YOU MEET  THE FOLLOWING 12 CRITERIA, IT  IS A MINISTERIAL APPROVAL, IF L  AND THEY'RE LAID OUT, THEN A  CUP IS REQUIRED. I'M GOING TO TAKE THE MOST  GENEROUS READING OF THE CODE  FOR THE APPLICANT WHICH I  DISAGREE WITH, BUT LET'S LET'S  TAKE STAFF'S ARGUMENT. IF YOU MEET THE 12 CRITERIA,  YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD. IF YOU DON'T MEET IT, A CUP IS  REQUIRED. UNFORTUNATELY, IT TOOK TWO, 245  MOTIONS WHILE THIS KEMENT  GETTING PUSHED FORWARD AND  PUSHED FORWARD AND SOMEHOW  STAFF WAS RELYING ON UPON A  SHEET THAT SAYS, THE APPLICANT  WROTE THIS, THE PROJECT NEEDS  ALL LOS ANGELES PERFORMANCE  STANDARDS AND METRICS UNDER  14.00. IT DOESN'T, IF THE PLAN AND FOR  SOME REASON WE BOUGHT IT. IF THIS PLANT SHEET HAD SAID  THE EARTH IS FLAT, I'M ASSUMING  THAT THERE IS PLANNERS THAT  WOULD PROFESS THAT THE EARTH IS  FLAT. THIS DOES NOT MEET THE  STANDARDS ITSELF. AND ON THE SECOND 245 WHAT CAME  BACK TO US, AFTER NUMEROUS,  MANY MANY MANY ARGUMENTS MADE  BY THE APPLICANT BY THE  APPELLANT, EXCUSE ME, BY THE  APPELLANT ON SEVERAL OF THE  EMISSIONS, WE HAVE A REPORT  THAT TELLS US THAT CONDITION 3  AND CONDITION 4 AND CONDITION  5, AREN'T MET. THAT SHOULD BE FULL STOP RIGHT  THERE ON THE MOST GENEROUS  READING, THAT SHOULD BE FULL  STOP. BUT SOMEHOW WE DON'T GET THERE. WHAT WE DO GET, FROM THE, FROM  THE DETERMINATION LETTER, THE  SECOND ONE THAT HAD TO COME OUT  BECAUSE WE HAD IT TWICE! WE HAVE A STATEMENT THAT AN RV  PARK, THIS IS IN CONCLUSION OF  THE COUPLE OF HUNDRED PAGES OF  REPORT:  AN RV PARK CAN BE  APPROVED UNDER THE SECTION I  DESCRIBED, IF IT COMPLIES WITH  THE REQUIRED PERFORMANCE  STANDARDS. A CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS,  THESE ARE NOT MY WORDS, THESE  ARE STAFF'S WORDS ARE REQUIRED  ONLY IF ONE OR MORE OF THE  STANDARDS ARE NOT MET. AND THEN WE GO ON TO READ, THAT  IN FACT, WE ARE UNCLEAR, AND  BELIEVE THAT STANDARD 3,  STANDARD 4 AND STANDARD 5 ARE  NOT MET. 3 DEALS WITH THE WALLS AND WE  HEARD TESTIMONY AND WALLS ARE  IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY DEFINE  BOUNDARIES AND SETBACKS AND  BUFFER ZONES FPT WE SEE THAT IN  ITEM 4 WHICH IS A DEFINITION OF  WHERE THE SETBACK HAS TO GO,  THAT IS REALLY REALLY CLEAR. THAT TWO THINGS CAN'T HAPPEN,  THEY CAN'T MEET THE PREVAILING  SETBACK OF 20 FEET AND ALSO  SQUEEZE IN 46RVs, IT'S  IMPOSSIBLE, MATHEMATICALLY  IMPOSSIBLE. ALTHOUGH WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE  PROJECT, THEY PROBABLY HAVE  OVER 50 STUB OUTS, SO THEY'RE  PLANNING ON PROGRAMMING THEM IN  AS TIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE. WE'LL PUT THAT ISSUE ASIDE. AND ITEM 5 DEALS WITH THE  LANDSCAPE AND BUFFER ZONE WHICH  ALSO DEFINES THE SIZE OF THE  PROJECT. SO IT'S VERY SIMPLE  PROPOSITION, IF THIS IS THE  PROJECT, A CUP IS REQUIRED. THE SETBACK, ADDED TO THE  PLANS, ADDED PLANS, THAT  SOUNDS LIKE A CHANGE TO ME. PLANS MUST ALSO BE UPDATED,  THAT'S A WORD FOR CHANGE, A  DIFFERENT PROJECT. THE PLANS MUST BE UPDATED TO  REFLECT THE CHANGES THAT MUFBT  NEEDED. NOT HAVING LABELS FOR A PLAN IS  DESIGNED FOR THING, TO BLOW  PAST THE STAFF AND GET A  MINISTERIAL APPROVAL THAT  REQUIRES A CUP. FOR CLEAR LABELS ANY PORTION OF  THE RV PARK IN THE LANDSCAPE  BUFFER WHICH WE KNOW, TODAY  MATHEMATICALLY, THEY'RE IN THE . ANY PORTION OF THE RV PARK MUST  BE RELOCATED, AND ADJUSTMENTS  RELOCATED ADJUSTMENTS,  DIFFERENT PROJECTTO THE  PROJECT DESIGN AND PLANS MADE  ACCORDINGLY. THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS  NEEDED FOR COMPLIANCE. NUMBERS 3, 4, AND 5.E MO*EFLT G  THE CODE FOR THE APPLICANT, CUP  IS REQUIRED. BUT WE COULD NOT --CONCLUDE,  WITH THE PLANNED SHEETS. THIS ISING THE PLANNED SHEET. THAT'SDIFFERENT PROJECT. A USE OF LAND, BUILDING PERMIT,  SO GIVE US A DIFFERENT PROJECT  AND WE'LL GIVE YOU A PERMIT. IF THEY CANNOT BE MET, THAT  PROVIDES RELIEF THAT WILL BE  NEEDED FOR THE LAND TO BE  ISSUED. ALL OF THESE, THESE HUNDREDS  AND HUNDREDS OF PAGES ARE  TELLING US THAT THE PROJECT  THAT THEY APPLIED FOR IN THE  GENEROUS READING OF THE CODE  TELLS US THAT A CUP IS REQUIRED  BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED THE  STANDARDS. AND YET, INEXPLICABLABLY,  THEY'RE SAYING, WE'LL WORK WITH  YOU. IF YOUR PROJECTCAN'T BE  APPROVED WITHOUT A CUP AND YOU  DON'T APPLY FOR A CUP YOU APPLY  FOR A NEW PROJECT. APPLY WITH A NEW PROJECT. CONFORM OR DON'T COME FORM WITH  THE CODE, CONFORM WITH THE  CODE, IF THIS IS THE PROJECT,  YOU WANT, IF THIS IS THE  PROJECT YOU WANT, AND I HELD  TUP A FEW TIMES, APPLY FOR A  CUP. SO MEMBERS, I'M URGING YOU TO  ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT OF TODAY  WHICH SAYS SIMPLY THAT THIS  PROJECT REQUIRES A CUP AND THAT  THE, USE OF LAND PERMIT SHALL  NOT ISSUE WHICH BY THE WAY, WAS  A DETERMINATION BELOW AND ANY  OUTSTANDING PERMITS, ALTHOUGH  THERE IS NOT CLEAR THAT THERE  IS ANY PERMIT, IN FACT THERE IS  STATEMENTS SAYING THERE IS NO  ACTIVE PERMIT, SHALL BE NULL  AND VOID, REAPPLY AND CONFORMED  TO THE CODE, I'M GOING TO URGE  AN AYE VOTE ON MY AMENDMENT. >> Council President:  COUNCILMEMBER BLUMENFIELD? >> B. Blumenfield: THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, MR. McOSKER AND AS  YOU KNOW, I'M SYMPATHETIC TO  THE SITUATION THAT YOU'RE IN  AND I SUPPORTED YOUR 245s, YOU  KNOW, I DON'T LIKE THIS PROJECT. I DON'T LIKE WHAT IT'S DOING IN  THE COMMUNITY. BUT IN PLANNING COMMITTEE, WE  VOTED TO DENY THE APPEAL. AND WE DID SO BECAUSE WE  EXHAUSTED ALL THE REMEDIES AND  WE WENT TO COURT IN TRIAL COURT  AND WE LOST. IF WE CONTINUE DOWN OAD. AND ALL OF US WHO HEARD THAT  SAID, OKAY, WE CANNOT CONTINUE  DOWN THIS ROAD. IT WOULD JUST BE THROWING GOOD  MONEY AFTER BAD. AS PAINFUL AS THAT IS, AND I  FEEL THE PAIN. I HAD A SIMILAR DIFFERENT KIND  OF THING WHEN ED1 CAME OUT,  THERE WAS A LITTLE BUG IN THE  SYSTEM WHERE DIDN'T GET DEFINED. I FOUGHT AGAINST IT, THIS  COUNCIL BACKED ME UP ON THAT. WE WENT TO COURT AND I DON'T  KNOW HOW WE LOST THAT, BUT WE  LOST IT. AND AT THAT POINT, WE HAD TO GO  TO THE COMMUNITY AND SAY, I  TRIED BUT WE LOST IN COURT AND  I CANNOT DRAG THE CITY THROUGH  MORE EXPENSES WHEN, YOU KNOW,  WE'RE GOING TO LOSE. THIS IS A SIMILAR SITUATION  HERE. BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE YOU OUGHT  TO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT  CLOSED SESSION WE HAD ON THE  LITIGATION. I WOULD ASK THAT WE SCHEDULE  THIS FOR A CLOSE SESSION. THERE IS A RELATED ITEM ON THE  LITIGATION THAT WE HEARD IN  COMMITTEE. NA IS REALLY SHAPES OUR VIEW ON  THIS ISSUE. SO, IN FAIRNESS TO EVERYBODY  HERE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THE  REASONS, THE LEGAL REASONS AND  HAVE OUR CITY ATTORNEY. WE CAN GET OUR CITY ATTORNEY  HERE BUT WE KNOW THEY'RE NOT  GOING TO SAY VERY MUCH OUTSIDE  OF THE CLOYSED SESSION. BUT, I CANNOT SUPPORT KNOWING  WHAT I KNOW, HAVING GONE  THROUGH THE CLOSED SESSION AND  AS MUCH AS I'M WITH YOU AND  WITH YOUR COMMUNITY ON THIS, I  CANNOT IN GOOD ANXIOUS SUPPORT  GRANTING AT PAEL WHEN I KNOW  THAT'S GOING TO COST US A  TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT  WE DON'T HAVE. THAT'S WHY I SUPPORTED THE ICO  TO MOVE FORWARD SO WE DON'T GET  IN THE SITUATION AGAIN. WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN IN  SITUATION AND WE SHOULD NOT BE  IN THIS SITUATION AND WE ARE. SO I GUESS, I SUGGEST THAT WE  CONTINUE THIS VOTE UNTIL WE  HEAR WHAT WAS SAID IN CLOSED  SESSION. >> Council President: GOT IT,  SO MR. BLUMENFIELD IS  REQUESTING THAT WE GO TO CLOSE  SESSION, WHICH WE WOULD HAVE TO  WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW TO DO THAT,  MR. McOSKER? >> T. McOsker: THERE IS A LOT  OF FRUSTRATIONS HERE. ONE OF THE MANY FRUSTRATIONS IS  THAT MY OFFICE WAS EXCLUDED  FROM THAT CLOSED SESSION. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR I WOULD  LIKE TO KNOW IN SESSION,  SO HEADS UP, WHETHER OR NOT  THIS INFORMATION THAT PROJECT  DOES NOT MEET THE STANDARDS IN  THE CODE WAS INTRODUCED IN THAT  LITIGATION, IF SO, WHAT WAS THE  RESPONSE OF THE COURT? AND IF NOT, WHY NOT. MR. PRESIDENT, THIS ITEM IS ON  A 245, IT'S TIME LIMITED, IT  EXPIRED TOMORROW. THE TIME LIMIT OF 245 EXPIRES  TOMORROW. I'M EAGER TO HEAR THE ARGUMENTS  AND RESPOND BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE  ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL BE  HEARD IN CLOSED, IF NOT TODAY,  IS THERE ANY REASON WHY IT  COULDN'T BE HEARD TODAY? >> City Attorney: IT CANNOT BE  HEARD TODAY, CORRECT, IT'S NOT  ON THE AGENDA AS A CLOSED  SESSION. >> Council President: AND WE'LL  ASK THE CLERK TO ISSUE A  CONTINUATION AGENDA FOR  TOMORROW, SO THAT WILL ASSURE  THAT IT'S ON THE AGENDA  TOMORROW AS A CLOSE SESSION  ITEM. >> T. McOsker: IN MY EXPERIENCE  GOING BACK A YEAR AND A HALF,  THERE IS A LOT OF YOU CANNOT  GET THERE FROM THE OFFICE. I WILL CONSENT TO CONTINUING  THIS ONE DAY, TO TOMORROW, WITH  AN ASSURANCE THAT WE'LL BE IN  CLOSED SESSION AND THIS ITEM  WILL BE ASKED AND ANSWERED. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT FOR  US? >> Clerk: YES, MR. PRESIDENT. SO FOR THE RECORD, ITEM NUMBER  15 WILL BE CONTINUED AS WELL AS  AMENDMENT McOSKER-PARK WILL BE  CONTINUED TO WEDNESDAY DECEMBER  3, ALONG WITHTHE CLOSE SESSION  COMPANION PIECE THAT IS RELATED  TO THIS MATTER, WILL ALSO BE ON  THE CONTINUATION AGENDA FOR  DECEMBER 3, THAT WILL BE ISSUED  TODAY, SIR. >> Council President: ALL RIGHT. SO THAT WILL BE THE ORDER. AND WE'LL RESUME THIS  DISCUSSION TOMORROW. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. ALL RIGHT, MADAM CLERK, WHAT IS  NEXT? >> Clerk: NEXT WOULD BE ITEM 21  AND THAT WAS CALLED SPECIAL BY  COUNCILMEMBER HUTT, THERE IS AN  AMENDMENT HUTT-McOSKER THAT HAS  BEEN CIRCULATED AND SUBMITTED. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, ANY COMMENTS  COUNCILMEMBER? ALL RIGHT, OPEN THE ITEM ON  THAT ITEM, CLOSE THE ROLL,  TABULATE THE VOTE. >> Clerk: 15 AYES. >> Council President: ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S NEXT? >> Clerk: NEXT WOULD BE ITEM  22, THERE ARE SEVERAL  AMENDMENTS, SO THE FIRST VOTE  FOR ITEM 22 IS ITEM 22-C AND  THAT IS MOTION RODRIGUEZ-LEE. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF  ITEMS BEFORE US. I WOULD ASK IF THE CAO'S OFFICE  COULD COME FORWARD? I'M SORRY, WRONG ITEM. LET'S CONSIDER THE FIRST YELLOW  22. SORRY I GOT AHEAD OF MYSELF. LET'S OPEN THE ROLL, CLOSE THE  ROLL, TABULATE THE VOTE. >> Clerk: 15 AYES. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, WHAT'S NEXT? >> Clerk: NEXT WOULD BE  AMENDMENT 22-B AND THAT IS  MOTION BLUMENFIELD-RODRIGUEZ. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, LET'S OPEN THE ROLL ON  THIS ITEM, CLOSE THE ROLL,  TABULATE THE VOTE. >> Clerk: 14 AYES, 1 NO. >> Council President: ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S NEXT? >> Clerk: NEXT, WOULD BE  AMENDMENT 22-A AND THAT IS  MOTION JURADO-HERNANDEZ. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, LET'S OPEN THE ROLL,  COUNCILMEMBER JURADO? LET'S MAKE SURE HER SOUND IS CD. >> Y. Jurado: COLLEAGUES I WANT  TO START BY-- >> Council President:  HOLD ON  COUNCILWOMAN. >> Y. Jurado: OKAY, COLLEAGUES  I WANT TO START BY SAYING  CLEARLY, I OUR CITY'S  COMMITMENT TO BUILD AFFORDABLE  HOUSING FASTER. SXIBL IN OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO  DELIVER HOUSING FOR THOSE WHO  NEED IT MOST. BUT I HAVE TO RAISE A SERIOUS  CONCERN ABOUT WHAT IS BEFORE US  TODAY. IT PUTS HOUSING AT REAL RISK OF  DISPLACEMENT, ESPECIALLY  NEIGHBORHOOD IN MY DISTRICT  LIKE BOYLE HEIGHTS AND LINCOLN  HEIGHTS. THIS PROTECTS OUR BUILDINGS  WITH 12 UNITS OR MORE, BUT THAT  DOES NOT REFLECT THE REALITY IN  MY DISTRICT. IN BOYLE HEIGHTS OUT OF THE  4400 PROPERTIES, ONLY 10 WOULD  BE EXCLUDED FROM THE PROCESS. IF WE KEEP THE EXEMPTION AT 12  UNITS, THEY BECOME VULNERABLE  DEMOLITION UNDER A BUY-RIGHT  PROCESS, NO VOICE FROM THE  COMMUNITY. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS  STREAMLINING DISPLACEMENT, OF  LATINO WORKING CLASS  NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE OUR  UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS THAT  HAVE A CLOSER COMMUTE TO OUR  OFFICE. SO THIS IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL  CONCERN, THIS IS DEVELOPMENT  WITH DISPLACEMENT, YES WE WANT  TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE  HOUSING BUT FOR WHOM? AND WHAT COST? I GUESS THE COST OF THE 4490RSO  PROPERTIES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUILDINGS  THAT SERVE THE FOUNDATION OF  MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSING,  WHERE NEIGHBORS SUPPORT EACH  OTHER. THAT'S WHY I INTRODUCED THE  AMENDMENT TO LOWER THE  EXEMPTION FROM 12 UNITS TO 5  UNITS. THIS IS A SMALL BUT NECESSARY  ADJUSTMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE  PROCESS DOES NOT  UNINTENTIONALLY BECOME A  PATHWAY TO DEMOLISH THE HOMES  THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS RELY ON. DO WE TALK ABOUT THE RESIDENTS  THAT LIVE IN A HOUSING OR ARE  WE INTEND TO GO BUILD OVER THEM  UNTIL THEY'RE NO LONGER HERE. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OR ASK  FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TO CUSS  THIS FURTHER IN COMMITTEE. THE AND LOOK AT THE DATA. WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS ACTUALLY  36 PERCENT OF THE RSO UNITS TO  BE EXEMPTED AND GUESS WHERE  MOST OF THEM ARE? CD14. THANK YOU. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, COUNCILMEMBER HERNANDEZ? >> Y. Jurado: OH YEAH, WE HAVE  TO SPEAK INTO THE RECORD, AN  AMENDMENT INTO THE AMENDMENT. NUMBER 5, REQUEST THE CITY  ATTORNEY TO INCORPORATE REQUEST  TO THE NUMBER OF UNITS, COMMA  INTO CHAPTER 1, PERIOD. >> Council President:  COUNCILMEMBER HERNANDEZ? >> E. Hernandez: 22-B. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, MR. BLUMENFIELD. >> B. Blumenfield: I WOULD LIKE  TO GET PLAN TO GO ANSWER SOME  QUESTIONS ON THIS? >> Council President: YES,  WE'LL ASK. >> B. Blumenfield: IT'S MY  UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MAYOR  HAS A LOST CONCERNS ABOUT THIS. AND THE CONCERN IS THIS CUTS  THE LEGS OUT FROM UNDER THE  EFFECTIVENESS OF ED1. IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE ZONING  IN TERMS OF WHAT BUILDINGS CAN  AND CANNOT BE DEMOLISHED BUT  IT'S SAYING, IF THERE IS A  5-BUNGALOW UNIT OR SOMETHING  THAT TO THAT AFFECT AND  SOMEBODY WANTS TO BUILD A 100  UNIT AND THEY'RE DECIDING  TO  DO THAT, THEY CANNOT USE ED1. SO IF I CAN GET PLANNING THIS O  IT CHOSEN IN IN THE MAYOR'S ED1  TO BE 12 UNITS? WHAT IS THE IMPACT IN YOUR  PERSPECTIVE ON ETHICACY OF ED1  IF WE GO DOWN TO FIVE MINUTES? >> Speaker: THANK YOU,  COUNCILMEMBERS, KEVIN KELLER,  EXECUTIVE OFFICER PLANNING. IT'S A POLICY ISSUE IN FRONT OF  THE COUNCIL TODAY. THE ORIGINAL ED1 DID NOT  INCLUDE ANY LANGUAGE OF RSO  DEMOLITION. RSO DEMOLITION IS COVERED BY  ELLIS ACT AND OTHER ORDINANCES  HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ADOPTED AND  NOT ALL PROGRAMS IN THE CITY  HAVE SPECIFIC CALL OUT FOR RSO  UNITS. IN 2024, THE MAYOR AMENDED, ED1  TO INCLUDE A 12-UNIT THRESHOLD. IT WAS THE FIRST THRESHOLD AND  IT WAS RESPONSIVE TO SOME OF  THE ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE SEEN  WHERE LARGER PROJECTS SHOULD BE  COME IN WITH SIGNIFICANT  AMOUNTS OF RSO HOUSING THAT  WERE REDEVELOPED FOR SLIGHTLY  MORE HOUSING. THAT THRESHOLD WAS SET AT 12 IN  THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVE THAT  WAS WHAT WAS ROLLED OVER INTO  THE ORDINANCE THAT IS IN FRONT  OF YOU TODAY. THE ORDINANCE IN FRONT OF THE  COUNCIL, GENERALLY MIRRORS AND  MATCHES THE ED1 PROGRAM THAT  THE CITY HAS BEEN USING. I CAN HAND IT OVER TO MATT TO  GIVE SOME HIGH LEVEL DATA ON  THE PROGRAM BUT LIKE THE  COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE SAID, THERE  ARE INSTANCES WHERE PROJECTS  ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH UNITS  UNDER 12 BUT MORE THAN 5, SO  THAT'S A POLICY CALL. BUT IT WOULD FURTHER LIMIT THE  ABILITY IN THIS CASE OF  AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO BE BUILT  ON THOSE PROPERTIES. MATT? >> Speaker: I CAN JUST PROVIDE  THIS MATH, CITY PLANNING, JUST  SOME DATA THAT WE HAVE. WE TOOK A LOOK QUICKLY AT ED7  PROJECTS AND THEIR IMPACTS I  KNOW COUNCILMEMBER NAZARIAN HAD  ASKED FOR THAT EARLIER. SO IF THAT'S HELPFUL, WE CAN  GET THAT UP HERE. WE APPROVED ABOUT 450 PROJECTS  OF THOSE 168 ABOUT REQUIRE THE  DEMOLITION OF HOUSING PROJECTS. 7.4 UNITS, THAT'S DEMOLITION OF  ABOUT 700 UNITS AT'S A  SIGNIFICANT NUMBER. THAT'S RATIO ABOUT 40 UNITS  BEING CREATED FOR EVERY RSO  LOST. THAT DOES NOT  INCLUDE--ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE  HOUSING IS A DIFFICULT THAT  I'LL RIVER TO THE COUNCIL ON  WHAT YOU WANT TO DO THS. THIS CHANGE FROM 5 TO 12, WOULD  I AM PABLGT ABOUT  PERCENT OF  PROJECTS BASED ON PAST DATA. WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD  CONVERT TO MARKET RATE OR IF  THEY WOULD NOT HAPPEN. BUT, YEAH, THIS IS A DIFFICULT  ISSUE AND WHERE TO FIND THA. I  WILL UNDERLINE THIS WAS PUT IN  PLACE THE 12-UNIT LIMIT, WHICH  IS UNIQUE TO HAVE A THRESHOLD  LIKE THAT. WAS PUT IN BEFORE THE ADOPTION  OF THE PROTECTION ORDINANCE. AND IN SOME WAYS MAY HAVE BEEN  A STOP-GAP TO THOSE ENHANCED  PROTECTION. SO THERE IS PROTECTIONS FOR  EVERY LOW INCOME TENANT THAT IS  DISLOCATED AND DISPLACED, UP TO  $100,000 FOR EVERY DISLOCATED  TENANTS AND A RIGHT TO RETURN  TO THAT BUILDING, THEY HAVE THE  RIGHT TO RETURN IF THE PROJECT  DOES NOT PROCEED. SO I WANTED TO COUNCIL TO BE  AWARE OF THOSE PROTECTIONS THAT  WERE MEANT TO ADDRESS THIS. WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER  ANYMORE QUESTIONS. >> Council President:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMAN? XRA*M >>  >> N. Raman: I HAVE A QUESTION  ON THE UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN  ENTITLED LIKE IN THE LAST  QUARTER, PREVIOUS QUARTER? AND COMPARED TO LAST YEAR AT  THIS TIME? OR THE PREVIOUS YEAR AT THIS  TIME? >> WELL, WE'RE TRYING TO GET  THAT DA TAUPE FOR YOU. THERE IS BEEN A DECLINE FROM  WHERE IT WAS A YEAR AGO, TWO  YEARS AGO. >> N. Raman: YEAH, I'M JUST  TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW STEEP  THE DECLINE HAS BEEN. AND COLLEAGUES, I THINK ED1 HAS  CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ITS  ORIGINAL FORM, AND SOME WAYS, I  THINK BENEFICIALLY, SOME WAYS  IN WAYS THAT HAVE UNDERMINED  THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTENT OF  THE ORDINANCE, AND WE HAVE A  NEW CHIP PROGRAM THAT I THINK  DOES A BETTER JOB OF BUILDING  THE HOUSING WHERE WE NEED T  IT'S FAIRLY THOUGHT OUT AND,  YOU KNOW, HAS A BETTER OVERALL  KIND OF SHAPE TO THE SYSTEM  ACROSS THE ENTIRE CITY THAN  WHAT ED1 HAS BECOME AFTER ALL  OF THESE CHANGES. AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE  EFFECTIVENESS AS WELL? >> I DO RECALL LOOKING AT THE  CHANGES, YEAH, IT WAS SORT OF A  PEAK. I BELIEVE IT'S MUCH AS 1/6 OF  NUMBER OF UNIT THAT WE'RE  SEEING COMING IN TODAY VERSUS  THERE IS BEEN A LOST  ADJUSTMENTS, THERE IS A LOT OF  ISSUES ON SECTION  VOUCHERS AND  THE ABILITY, THERE IS A LOT OF  PEOPLE BET ON EARLY ON. >> N. Raman: YEAH, SO IF IT'S  1/6 OF WHAT IT WAS VERSUS A  YEAR AGO TWO YEARS AGO, WHAT  ARE ALREADY THE NUMBER OF  ENTITLEMENTS THAT HAVE RESULTED  IN UNITS BEING BUILT OR HOUSING  STARTS? >> YEAH, SO I THINK THE LAST  TIME I LOOKED AT THIS MAYBE A  MONTH OR TWO AGO, ROUGHLY OF  THE 40 OF THE 400 PROJECTS HAVE  GONE ALL THE WAY AND STARTED  CONSTRUCTION WITH THE BUILDING  PERMIT. >> N. Raman: SO ABOUT 10  PERCENT? >> ABOUT 10 PERCENT, THERE IS A  LAG OF PEOPLE PERMITTING. BUT IT'S ALSO A VERY DIFFICULT  BUILDING PERIOD. >> N. Raman: AND THE  ENTITLEMENTS EXPIRE AFTER TWO  YEARS? >> I'M SORRY? >> N. Raman: AND ENTITLEMENT  EXPIRE? >> I BELIEVE IT'S TWO OR THREE  YEARS, I'M NOT SURE. >> I BELIEVE IT'S THREE YEARS,  COUNCILMEMBER. >> N. Raman: OKAY, DO YOU HAVE  THE NUMBER OF PERMITS FROM LAST  QUARTER OR EVEN LAST MONTH  VERSUS THE SAME MONTH LAST YEAR? >> Speaker: THIS IS KEVIN  KELLER, WE DID PULL THAT DATA,  BUT YOU'RE CORRECT, THE  APPLICATIONS HAVE CONTINUED. BUT THEY HAVE DECLINED SINCE  THE SUMMER OF 2024. >> N. Raman: OKAY, I WOULD JUST  SAY, COLLEAGUES, YOU KNOW, I  THINK, I'M HAPPY TO, I  SUPPORTED THIS IN COMMITTEE,  I'M NOT SURE HOW USEFUL THIS  PROGRAM IS, IN TERMS OF PUSHING  FOR ACTUAL NEW UNITS. THE CHANGES THAT WE'RE MAKING  TODAY ARE GOING TO FURTHER CUT  INTO THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE  BEING ABLE TO USE IT. BUT IT MAY NOT BE MAKE THAT  MUCH OF AN IMPACT GIVEN THE ACT  TO DRAW PEOPLE IN. I SUPPORTED IT IN COMMITTEE, I  WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT  TODAY BUT I THINK IT HAS  ALREADY LOST SOME OF ITS  ORIGINAL POTENCY AND WE SHOULD  LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS TO SEE HOW  WE CAN GENERATE NEW HOUSING. THANK YOU. >> Council President:  COUNCILMEMBER JURADO. >> Y. Jurado: THANK YOU,  PLANING DEPARTMENT. I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY SO IF  WE MADE THE MATERIAL CHANGE T  WOULD ONLY AFFECT THE 8 PERCENT  OF THE APPLICANTS THAT WE  CURRENT LIE HAVE? SO THIS SEEMS NOMINAL FOR ME  AND I HOPE FOR OTHER  COLLEAGUES, THAT WILL BE AS  WELL. OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT  OUT, IS OUR, FROM MY  EPERIENCE, WHICH IS NOT A LOT,  BUT, I THINK AREN'T RENT  CONTROL THAT HAVE OLDER  BUILDINGS MAY BE CHEAPER IN A  MARKET THAT IS DEPRESSED TO BE  PREYED  ON. AND THOSE HAVE THE ONE THAT  PEOPLE WANT TO BUY AND REMODEL. AND WITHOUT A RESCIND CATER,  THOSE ARE IN THE COST, THE COST  ARE HUMAN LIVES OF OUR WHO CAME  IN OR DAY OUT, WHO CAME FOR 3  PERCENT RENT CAP. AND OUR PRIMARY DUTY WITH OUR  LAND USE, THEN WHAT ARE WE  DOING HERE? AND IT'S ONLY  PERCENT. I'M ASKING YOU TO RECONSIDER, I  WISH MY VOICE DIDN'T BREAK AT  THAT MOMENT, BUT I HOPE YOU  RECONSIDER. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS  ON THIS ITEM, MADAM CLERK F YOU  CAN RESTATE WHAT IS BEFORE US. >> Clerk: WHAT IS BEFORE  COUNCIL IS 22-A AND THAT IS  MOTION JURADO-HERNANDEZ AS  AMENDED BY MOTION  JURADO-HERNANDEZ. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, BEFORE WE CALL THE  QUESTION, WE HAVE MR. NAZARIAN  AND MR. BLUMENFIELD. >> A. Nazarian: THANK YOU, MR.  PRESIDENT, WHEN I SAW THE  MOTION I WAS READY TO SUPPORT  IT BECAUSE IT LIMIT TODAY CD14  ITSELF. BUT IN YOUR AMENDMENT, YOU  EXPANDED TO THE ENTIRE CITY  WHICH I ALSO APPRECIATE BECAUSE  I'VE HAD CONCERNS OVER THIS IN  MY OWN DISTRICT. I HAVE A PROJECT THAT IS GOING  TO DEMOLISH FIVE UNITS AND  BUILD 103 WITH NO PARKING IN  ALREADY CAPACITY COLLECTOR'S  STREET ALL BECAUSE IT'S IN THE  BLOCK OF ORANGE LINE, IT WILL T  TENANTS WILL BE UTILIZING THAT  MODE OF TRANSPORTATION SWI W*I  IS A VERY BIG ASSUMPTION. SO I UNDERSTAND, AND BY THE  WAY, THE FIVE UNITS ARE ALSO  RSO. BUT THE BALANCE IS SOMEWHERE IN  BETWEEN, WHEN WE TAKE ACTION  LIKE THIS TO IMPACT THE  ENTIRETY OF THE CITY WE ARE  ALSO DIMINISHING THE INTENT OF  SOMETHING THAT WAS MEANT TO  PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO, INSTEAD OF VOTING ON THIS  NOW, WOULD THIS BODY BE  AMENABLE FOR THIS BODY TO GO  BACK TO COMMITTEE SO WE CAN  FIND A BERT BALANCE ON HOW WE  ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT HAS COME  UP BY COLLEAGUE BY CD14. I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND I  THINK IT'S EXTREMELY VALID BUT  LOWERING IT TO FIVE UNITS FOR  THE ENTIRETY OF THE CITY I  THINK COULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES  THAT WE DON'T WANT. >> Council President: OKAY,  THAT'S A MOTION TO CONTINUE THE  COMPLETE ITEM? I GUESS WE HAVE TO DO THE  COMPLETE ITEM IF WE DON'T DO  THE AMENDMENT. BUT I'VE GOT MR. BLUMENFIELD ON  THE QUEUE. >> B. Blumenfield: THAT'S WHAT  I WAS GOING TO SPEAK TO. CAN WE JUST, IT'S IMPORTANT IF  WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT HOUSING,  ED1, IT'S BEEN AFFECTIVE. WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AND  MAYBE PUSH IN AMENDMENT THE  COMMITTEE JUST LIKE SOME OF THE  OTHER AMENDMENTS ARE REALLY  GOING TO THE COMMITTEE AND  INSTRUCTING PLANNING, LIKE B,  IT'S NOT INSTRUCTING THEM TO DO  AN ORDINANCE. ALONG THAT VAIN IF WE CAN SEND  A TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE WHAT  ARE THE TRADEOFFS, BUT NOT SLOW  DOWN THE ACTUAL ED1, I THINK  THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE AND I  WOULD PUT THAT FORWARD AS A  OPTION OF TO SEND ITEM A TO  COMMITTEE BUT TO MOVE FORWARD  WITH THE UNDERLYING ED1. >> Council President: ALL RIGHT  THE MOTION IS TO REFER THE  AMENDMENT TO COMMITTEE? COUNCILMEMBER HERNANDEZ. >> E. Hernandez: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER BLUMENFIELD JUST  SAID THAT A LOST GREAT STUFF  HAS HAPPENED UNDER ED1 HOW MANY  UNITS HAVE BEEN BUILT UNDER ED1? >> COUNCILMEMBER I DON'T THINK  WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONSTRUCTED  UNITS, WE'RE LOOKING AT AND IT   JULY, THERE ARE 44 PROJECTS,  THAT'S ABOUT 2500 UNITS. AS FAR AS COMPLETED, I DON'T  KNOW IF I CAN SPEAK TO THAT. >> Council President: BEFORE  SINCE THE BEGINNING? >> I'VE GOT 2500. >> Council President: SORRY,  2500. 44 PROJECTS. ALL RIGHT, ANYTHING ELSE  COUNCILMEMBER? >> E. Hernandez: I'M GLAD Y'ALL  YOU BROUGHT THAT UP AND THAT'S  GREAT, AND I'VE ONLY SEEN THE  NEGATIVE IMPACTS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER  TOLAN WAY AND NOW WE'RE TRYING  TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE BUY THAT  BUILDING. I HAD 17 FAMILIES TO BE  DISPLACED UNDER ED1, FOR US  WE'VE BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END  SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TODAY HEAR  IF THERE WAS MOVEMENT IN  CONSTRUCTION AND IF THERE HAS  BEEN EXPEDITING OF THAT. IT'S WORRISOME ON SOME OF US  THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE OPPOSITE  SIDE OF IT. >> Council President: ALL RIGHT. SO I THINK MADAM CLERK, WHAT IS  BEFORE US IS TO CONTINUE THE  AMENDMENT? >> Clerk: MR. PRESIDENT, SO FOR  22-A, DOES COUNCIL WISH TO  REFER THIS TO THE PLANNING  LAND USE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE? >> Council President: IF THERE  IS NO OBJECTION, THAT WILL BE  THE ORDER. COUNCILMEMBER JURADO? >> Y. Jurado: CAN WE REFER TO  HNH AS WELL. >> Council President: REFER TO  HNH AS WELL. >> Clerk: YES, FOR THE RECORD  22-A WILL BE  REFERRED TO THE  PLANNING AND LAND USE, AS WELL  AS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS  COMMITTEE. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, WHAT'S NEXT? >> Clerk: SO WHAT THE FINAL  VOTE IS NOW,-- >> E. Hernandez: ? >> Council President: W GOT IT. COUNCILMEMBER HERNANDEZ TO  COMMENT ON THE ENTIRE PACKAGE? >> E. Hernandez: IN 22-B, THIS  ONE CAME VERY QUICKLY I HAVE  WILLIAM NEED WHO IS  NR LIKE TO  VOTE AND SEND IT BACK TO  COMMITTEE, PLEASE. >> Y. Jurado: SECOND. >> Council President: YOU'VE  GOT LIKE THREE SECONDS. SO WE NEED TO A VOTE TO  RECONSIDER THAT. >> Clerk: YES. SO 22-B, JUST REAL QUICK, THE  VOTE TO RECONSIDER IS NOW  BEFORE COUNCIL. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, LET'S OPEN THE ROLE ON  RECONSIDERATION, CLOSE THE  ROLL, TABULATE THE VOTE. >> Clerk: 15 AYES. >> Council President: MR.  BLUMENFIELD. >> B. Blumenfield: I'M HAPPY TO  RECONSIDER AND EVEN SEND IT  BACK. BUT JUST THIS IS TO BE CLEAR,  22-B, THEY ASKED TO US DO THIS  AT THE LAST MINUTE, YOU'RE  RIGHT BUT IT'S JUST AN  INSTRUCTION, WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY  DOING IT. SO EITHER WAY, WHETHER WE SEND  IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT  THE INSTRUCTION AGAIN OR THEY  DO IT, I'M FINE EITHER WAY BUT  JUST TO BE CLEAR, WE'RE NOT  VOTING ON THE UNDERLYING  ORDINANCE TOO DO THIS, I WOULD  HAVE BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH THAT  AS WELL, GIVEN THAT THEY  BROUGHT THIS TO US TODAY. BUT I AM COMFORTABLE WITH  INSTRUCTING THEM TO DO IT. I DO THINK THAT HACLA HAS A  POINT. >> E. Hernandez: THANK YOU, AND  I HOPE HACLA HEARS ME, PLEASE  COME TO ME SO WE CAN HAVE THE  CONVERSATION, BECAUSE FOR NOW,  WE HAVE NOT HAD THE  CONVERSATION. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO REFER  THAT ITEM IF THERE IS NO  OBJECTION, WE'LL REFER THAT  ITEM TO PLANNING AND LAND USE  MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE AND  HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. >> Clerk: CAN COUNCIL DO A  QUICK VOTE ON THE REFERRAL FOR  22-B. >> Council President: WE NEED A  VOTE ON REFERRAL? I JUST REFERRED THE OTHER ONE  WITHOUT A VOTE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S OPEN THE ROLL ON THOSE  REFERRALS. CLOSE THE ROLL, TABULATE THE  VOTE. >> Clerk: 15 AYES. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, SO THERE WE GO. >> Clerk: OKAY, AND NOW THE  FINAL VOTE IS ITEM 22 THAT'S  THE PLUM REPORT AS AMENDED BY  MOTION 22-C AND THAT IS MOTION  RODRIGUEZ. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, LET'S OPEN THE ROLL ON  THAT ITEM, CLOSE THE ROLL,  TABULATE VOTE. >> Clerk: 15 AYES. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF CITY  La primera. Motion La motion de Park is a motion to adopt aMcOS  AND THAT'S THE MOTION TO ADOPT  THE L.A. AD HOC RECOVERY REPORT  AS WELL AS THE ORDINANCE ON  FILE. >> Council President: IT SO  LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE TWO REPORTS  AND AN ADDITIONAL AMENDMENT FOR  THIS. I'M GOING TO ASK THE CAO'S  OFFICE TO COME FORWARDAND TO  EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  THE VARIANCE BETWEEN THE  REPORTS THAT ARE BEFORE US. >> Speaker: HELLO GOOD  AFTERNOON, I DON'T LAND WITH  THE CAO AND JOINED BY GALVAN  ALSO FROM THE CAO'S OFFICE. THE REPORTS, FIRST I WANT TO  CLARIFY THAT BOTH WAIVE  PERMITTING AND BUILDING FEES  FOR ALL TYPES OF STRUCTURES,  SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES,  CONDOMINIUMS, TRAILER PARKS ALL  TYPES OF STRUCTURES. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE  BUDGET AND FINANCE REPORT  RECOMMENDS THAT WE ONLY WAIVE  THE FEES FOR THOSE STRUCTURE  THAT'S ARE GOING TO REBUILD UP  TO 110 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL  STRUCTURE. BOTH REPORTS WILL HAVE  FISCAL IMPACT IN THE CITY AS WE  HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE FEE  WAIVERS FROM GENERAL FUND  DOLLARS. THE DIFFERENCE IS, THE BUDGET  AND FINANCE RECOMMENDATIONS, WE  ESTIMATE THAT THOSE  RECOMMENDATIONS WILL COST THE  CITY UP TO 60 MILLION DOLLARS  PLUS THE COST OF BORROWING. AND THE AD HOC RECOVERY VOTE  CAN COST THE CITY UP TO 278  MILLION PLUS THE COST OF  BORROWING. >> Council President: COME ON,  PEOPLE DIDN'T YELL OUT WHEN YOU  WERE TALKING. LELT THE COUNCIL HAVE THIS  DISCUSSION. ALL RIGHT, MADAM C A O? >> SO BASED ON THE FISCAL  IMPACT AND THE FACT THAT THE  FINANCE AND BUDGET REPORT DOES  WAIVE THE FEES FOR UP TO 110  PERCENT OF THE SIZE OF THE  ORIGINAL STRUCTURE, WE  RECOMMEND THAT THE COUNCIL  APPROVE THE BUDGET AND FINANCE. >> Council President: I WILL  ONE QUESTION AND THEN WE'LL GO  TO COUNCILMEMBER PARK. YOU SAID YOU OPENED WITH BOTH  REPORTS COVERING UP TO 110  PERCENT. >> NOT BOTH. THE BUDGET AND FINANCE  COMMITTEE REPORT WOULD WAIVE  THE FEES FOR ALL STRUCTURES  THAT BUILD UP TO 110 PERCENT OF  ORIGINAL STRUCTURE. THE AD HOC RECOVERY BOARD WOULD  WAIVE THE FEES FOR ANY, IF  SOMEBODY WANTS TO DOUBLE THE  SIZE OF THEIR STRUCTURE, THOSE  FEES WOULD BE RECOVERED. SO THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE  SIZE OF THE STRUCTURE BEYOND  THE ORIGINAL SIZE, IF THAT  MAKES SENSE. >> Council President: GOT IT. COUNCILMEMBER PARK. >> T. Park: THANK YOU, MS.  CHAVEZ I'M READING FROM THE  BUDGET AND FINANCE REPORT,  INSTRUCTION NUMBER 2, IS TO  WAIVE THE BUILDING PERMIT FEES  OF SINGLE-FAMILY STRUCTURES AND  DUPLEXES, AT THE 110 PERCENT  LEVEL. THAT IS NOT ALL STRUCTURES. >> Council President: THANK  YOU, COUNCILMEMBER PARK. THAT WAS THE PROBLEM I WAS  HAVING IN ONE OF THEM IT SPELLS  OUT AND LAND STRUCTURES AND IN  ANOTHER ONE IT DOESN'T. IT DOESN'T MATCH UP. >> T. Park: WHAT MS. CHAVEZ  SAID IS UNCORRECT IN HER  DESCRIPTION IN THE TWO REPORTS. >> SO THE DRAFT ORDINANCE AS  PRESENTED BEFORE YOU TODAY,  DOES NOT INCLUDE A LIMITING OR  TO ONLY FAMILY IT WOULD APPLY  TO ALL PROPERTIES. >> Council President: SO  YOU'RE, IT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING  AND I'M NOT SURE IF  COUNCILMEMBER PARK WAS DONE,  BUT YOU'RE SAYING TO US, THAT  YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE  INCREASED%BACKERED TIME THREE  JUST ON PROPERTIES THAT MIGHT  BUILD OVER 110 PERCENT? >> THAT ESTIMATE IS FROM  BUILDING AND SAFETY. AND I WANT TO CLARIFY ONE  THING, THE DIFFERENCES IS THAT  THE ORDINANCE BEFORE YOU,  BASICALLY COVERS ALL  STRUCTURES, THE ONLY CHANGE THE  BUILDING AND BUDGET AND FINANCE  REPORT IS ASKING THAT, THE  CHANGE TO BE MADE TO THE  ORDINANCE, THE CITY ATTORNEY  HAS PRESENTED IS THAT THE FEE  WAIVER SUPPLY TO ONLY  STRUCTURES THAT BUILD UP TO 110  PERCENT. BUT THE KURNL LANGUAGE OF THE  ORDINANCE APPLIES TO ALL  STRUCTURES. >> Council President:  COUNCILMEMBER PARK? >> T. Park: I DON'T KNOW HOW TO  EXPLAIN THE DISCREPANCY, WHY IT  DOES NOT MATCH THE DESCRIPTION  IN THE ORDINANCE. WE CAN HAVE TH  CITY ATTORNEY COME UP AS WELL. THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT  THEY REQUEST THE CITY ATTORNEY  REVISE THE ORDINANCE TO APPLY  UP TO 110 PERCENT OF THE SIZE. >> T. Park: THE WORDINGS IS  VERY CLEAR, IT IS SINGLE-FAMILY  STRUCTURES AND DUPLEXES DAMAGED  OR DESTROYED UP TO 110 PERCENT. >> COUNCILMEMBERS, WITH REGARD  TO BUDGET AND FINANCE  COMMITTEE, THEY DID HAVE A  LIMITATION THAT IT WAS TO  FAMILY HOMES AND DUPLEXES BEING  REPLACED. AGAIN, THIS WAS A REQUEST TO  THE CITY ATTORNEY TO DRAFT AN  ORDINANCE, THIS BODY OF COURSE  COULD CONSIDER AMENDING THAT  FURTHER, IF THAT IS THE DESIRE  OF THE BODY TO BE MORE  EXPANSIVE. BUT THE RECOMMENDATION BEFORE  YOU IN BUDGET AND COMMITTEE  REPORT, DOES FOCUS ONLY A  SINGLE-FAMILY AND DUPLEXES. AGAIN IT'S A RECOMMENDATION FOR  A REQUEST TO CITY ATTORNEY TO  DRAFT AN ORDINANCE BECAUSE THAT  ORDINANCE IS NOT BEFORE YOU YET. >> SO MY STRUGGLE IN THIS AND  I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THE CITY  HAVING MONEY. BUT MY NEED EXCLUDES ALL  PROPERTY THAT ARE NOT  DUPLICATED AND SINGLE-FAMILY  HOMES. SO IF THEY ARE SHOWER SHOP AND  I WANT TO REBUILD MY SHOWER  SHOP, I'M OUT IN THE BUDGET AND  FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT. OR CONDOMINIUM. >> THAT'S CORRECT. >> FOR CLARIFICATION, THIS  LANGUAGE IS DIRECTLY FROM THE  ORDINANCE. IT SHOULD APPLY TO THE WORK  HAPPENED ANDTHE CURRENT ORDINAN  BEFORE YOU, THAT WAS DRAFTED BY  CITY ATTORNEY BEFORE THE BUDGET  AND FINANCE CONSIDERATION, WAS  VERY EXPANSIVE. IT INCLUDED PROPERTIES THAT IT  WOULD BASICALLY INCLUDE ALL  PROPERTIES. [APPLAUSE] IT WOULD INCLUDE SINGLE-FAMILY  HOMES T WOULD INCLUDE DUPLEXES,  IT WOULD INCLUDE,  FLOWER SHOPS  ALL PROPERTIES BUT NO  GUIDELINES IN THE SIZE OF THE  REBUILDING. AND I THINK THAT'S THE  DIFFERENCE. THE SIZE OF THE REBUILD AS MS.  CHAVEZ INDICATED, IF THE  REBUILD WAS DOUBLE, THAT COULD  CONCEIVABLY INCREASE THE FISCAL  IMPACT. SO IN THE BUDGET AND FINANCE  REPORT, IT WAS A REQUEST TO  PREPARE A NEW ORDINANCE THAT  WOULD FOCUS ON SINGLE-FAMILY  AND DUPLEXES AND FOCUS ON  REBUILD AND ALSO BE CONSISTENT  WITH THE MAYOR'S EMERGENCY  EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT LIMITED  TOE 110 PERCENT. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, MR.  PRESIDENT, THAT IT WAS FOCUSED  ON SINGLE-FAMILY AND DUPLEXES. >> Council President: SO, SO  IF, A MEMBER OF THIS BODY WERE  TO HAVE THE NUANCE POSITION  THAT EVERYBODY WHO LOST A  STRUCTURE WHETHER IT'S  RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL  SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE LOLLED  WITHOUT KEYS BUT DO NOT  SUPPORT, THIS PERSON DOES NOT  SUPPORT AN OPEN-ENDED. YOU HAD AN FLOWER SUPPORT AND  NOW WANT IT THREE TIMES BIGGER. IF THE PERSON DOES NOT SUPPORT  THAT BUT SUPPORTS THE FLOWER  SHOP. DID EITHER OF THESE TAKE CARE  OF THAT? >> YOU WOULD HAVE TO AMEND THE  BUDGET AND FINANCE REPORT TO  ONLY AMEND, THE ORDINANCE  PRESENTED BY THE CITY ATTORNEY  TO INCLUDE THAT FEES WOULD ONLY  APPLY TO  STRUCTURES. >> Council PresidenCOST ESTIMAT? >> OUR COST ESTIMATE IS ON ALL  BASED STRUCTURES. >> Council President: SO THERE  ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND  YOU ONLY PRESENTED TWO NUMBERS. THERE IS REBUILDING, RESIDENT  RNL, UP TO 110 PERCENT, THEN  THERE IS REBUILDING ANY  STRUCTURE LOST UP TO 110  PERCENT. AND THEN BASICALLY ANY BUILDING  PERMIT ANYBODY WANTS OF ANY  SIZE. WHICH ONE OF THESE NUMBERS  APPLY TO THE THREE THINGS? >> SO THE ESTIMATES WE RAN, IF  YOU LOOK AT OUR REPORT FROM  DATED OCTOBER 2, THE ATTACHMENT  THE VARIOUS TYPES OF STRUCTURES  INCLUDNG MULTI FAMILY  COMMERCIAL,  ADUs, AND GRADING  AND THE ESTIMATE FOR ALL OF  THOSE WITHOUT REBUILDING  LIMITATION IS CAN BE UP TO 278  MILLION. THE ESTIMATE FOR ALL OF THOSE  IF YOU DO UP TO 210 PERCENT OF  THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE IS UP TO  16 MILLION.I WOULD ADD THAT BOT  ESTIMATES DO PRESUME THAT ALL  PROPERTIES AFFECTED BY THE  WILDFIRES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE. >> Council President: IT WOULD  BE GREAT IF THEY BOTH SAID THAT. BL BLUMENFIELD. >> B. Blumenfield: I AGREE THAT  THEY SHOULD SAY THAT AND MAYBE  WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT MAKE  ITING SAY THAT. I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE STORIES  THAT WE HEARD FROM THE FOLKS  LOSING THEIR HOMES AND WE NEED  TO DO WHAT WE CAN AS A CITY. THE FEE WAIVER CONCEPT IS A  TRICKY BECAUSE, IT JUST MEANS  THE GENERAL FUND IS PAYING FOR  THE FEES. IT'S NOT LIKE THE CITY IS  COLLECT THISING MONEY FOR  ANYTHING ELSE. IF WE WAIVE IT UNDER PROP 218,  WE CANNOT SPREAD THAT FEE ON TO  OTHER FOLKS, SO IT ENDS UP  BEING A DIRECT COST AT A TIME  THAT WE ARE REALLY STRUGGLING  FINANCIALLY. THAT BEING SAID, WE SAID LOOK  AS HARD IT IS FOR THE CITY TO  OBSERVE THIS AND IT'S 86  MILLION DOLLARS IN TERMS OF  WHAT NA MEANS FOR THE  FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE AND  STREETS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN  THE CITY, WE WANT TO GO AHEAD  AND SPEND THAT MONEY, THAT 86  MILLION DOLLARS ON FOLKS WHO  HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES AND ALLOW  THEM TO REBUILD. BUT TO REBUILD WHAT THEY LOST  WHICH IS UNDER THE EXECUTIVE  DIRECTIVE, UP TO 110 PERCENT. AND I THINK THAT'S IS FAIR. THAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT AS  A CITY TO OBSERVE THAT--ABSORB  THAT, WE DON'T GET E IT, WE CAN. BUT WE SHOULD PAY NA. --THAT. I'M SORRY, I CANNOT TALK WHILE  PEOPLE ARE TALKING. IT'S A REALITY FOLKS, THAT'S  HOW OUR BUDGET WORKS. I THINK OUR FEES ARE WAY TOO  HIGH AND WE NEED TO FIGURE  OUTWEIGH TO SEE AVOID HAVING A  LOT OF FEES THAT WE HAVE AND  HAVE SELF CERTIFICATION, I'VE  BEEN AT THE FOR FRONT OF DOING  THOSE THINGS SO FEES ARE NOT SO  RIDICULOUSLY HIGH. BUT WHERE THEY ARE NOW,  SOMEBODY PAYS IT. IT'S GOING TO BE THE TAXPAYER,  IT'S GOING TO COME AT THE  EXPENSE OF EVERYTHING WE DO AS  A CITY. THAT BEING SAID, I'M GOING TO  SAY TO MY CONSTITUENTS IN THE  WEST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY, I'M  SORRY, WE'RE NOT GOING TO PAVE  YOUR ROAD BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO  THIS ANYWAY, BECAUSE WE NEED TO  HELP THE PEOPLE WHO'S HOUSES  BURNED DOWN. SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR  MONEY THAT WOULD GO TO-->> City  Attorney: MEMBERS OF THE  PUBLIC, WE ALREADY HAD PUBLIC  COMMENT.President: YOU'RE  DISRUPTING THIS MEETING, THIS  IS YOUR FIRST AND LAST WARNING. >> B. Blumenfield: I'M TRYING  TO MAKE A SACRIFICE FOR THE  FOLKS WHO ARE STANDING HERE,  AND FOR THE FOLKS THAT LIVE IN  THE COMMUNITY. IT IS COMING OUT OF THE POCKET  OF MY CONSTITUENTS AND OUT OF  THE POCKET OF THIS ENTIRE CITY. JUST THIS WEEKEND, WE WERE  TALKING TO FOLKS WHO HAD  CAPITOL STRUCTURE THAT HAVE  WASHED OUT DURING THE RAINS AND  WE'RE TOLD, YOU CANNOT DO THAT  BECAUSE ALL THE RESOURCES ARE  GOING TO THE PALISADES, THAT'S  WHAT WE'RE TOLD BY THE  DEPARTMENTS WHEN WE COULDN'T  GET A PROJECT DONE. AND I SAY THAT, BUT I  UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE I'M VERY  SYMPATHETIC TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE  LOST EVERYTHING. BUT WHAT THE COMMITTEE DID BY  LIMITING IT TO REBUILDING 110  PERCENT IS A VERY GENERAL PUS  THING FOR THIS CITY TO DO AN  APPROPRIATE THING. AND TO DO OTHERWISE, TO GO ON  AND SAY, THERE IS NO LIMIT,  THAT YOU CAN TAKE A FLOWER SHOP  AND TURN IT INTO A WAL-MART OR  SOMETHING THAT GOES WAY BEYOND  GETTING BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE. THAT GOES INTO FURTHER BUILDING. SO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO  LIMIT THE REBUILD OF THE PERMIT  THAT WE'RE GOING TO OBSERVE AS  A CITY TO 110 PERCENT OF WHAT  WAS THERE. SO THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING  THE BUDGET COMMITTEE PROPOSAL  WHICH IS, WHICH IS TO GIVE 86  MILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING TO  PAYING THE FEES FOR FOLKS WHO'S  HOMES HAVE BEEN BURNED DOWN. AND ANY STRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN  BURNED DOWN IN THE PALISADES. >> YEAH, WE ALSO FROM OUR  UNDERSTANDING, BUDGET AND  FINANCE LIBERATION ON THIS  ITEM, WE DON'T BELIEVE YOU THE   STRUCTURE DURING THAT  DISCUSSION. SO WE KNOW THAT'S IN THE CITY  REPORT BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE  THAT WAS THE DECISION THAT WAS  MADE THAT IT WAS ALL STRUCTURES  UP TO 110 PERCENT OF THE  ORIGINAL. >> B. Blumenfield: AS A  PRACTICAL MEATER, A LOST  COMMERCIAL STRUCTURES AND  LARGER STRUCTURES ARE GOING TO  BE FULLY INSURED. AND IF THEY ARE FULLY INSURED,  THIS DOES AN MRIE,  A--APPLY,  IS THAT CORRECT? >> THAT'S CORRECT. >>B. Blumenfield: MOST THOSE  OTHER STRUCTURE THAT'S WOULD  COST A LOT, I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU  GOING TO REBUILD A MULTI FAMILY  STRUCTURE IF YOU DON'T HAVE  INSURANCE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE  TO  DO IT. BUT, I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE  FOR US TO GO TO THE 110 PERCENT. >> Council President: THANK  YOU, MR. BLUMENFIELD. COUNCILMEMBER PADILLA. >> I. Padilla: YOU KNOW, AS  SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT ON BFI OR  ADD HO, I'VE GOT TO--AD HOC,  I'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT MY  FRUSTRATION WITH HOW THIS  WAS  PRESENTED. I LISTENED TO THE COMMUNITY AND  TALKS TO MY KLAOEGD WAS THERE A  WAY TO SIMPLIFY TO SAY THAT WE  WOULD WAIVE THESE FEES IF AND  ONLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO REBUILD  YOUR ORIGINAL DWELLING SIZE AND  IF WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT IT'S  HOUSING, JUST AS A WAY TO MAKE  SURE THAT WE DON'T ALLOW FOR A  SITUATION FOR A FLOWER SHOP TO  QUADRUPLE IN SIZE? WHY WAS IT SO DIFFICULT TO DO  >> SO THAT LANGUAGE OF 110  PERCENT COMES FROM BUILDING AND  SAFETY AND THAT'S WHAT THEY USE  FOR THESE TYPES OF REBUILDING  IS THE USE THAT MEASURE IN  TERMS OF BUILDING TO ORIGINAL  SIZE. >>  >> I. Padilla: OKAY, NO FURTHER  QUESTIONS. >> Council President:  COUNCILMEMBER NAZARIAN. >> A. Nazarian: THANK YOU  COUNCIL PRESIDENT, JUST AN  ELEMENTARY-LEVEL QUESTION SO I  UNDERSTAND SOMETHING. IF THE 110, BUDGET AND FINANCE  PROPOSAL OF UP TO 110 PERCENT  WAIVER IS PASSED TODAY, BUT AN  OWNER OF A PROPERTY DECIDES TO  BUILD UP TO 150 PERCENT, DO  THEY GET THE FEES WAIVED ON THE  110 PERCENT PORTION? AND THEN THEY NEED TO PAY FOR  THE REMAINING 40 PERCENT UNDER  THAT PROPOSAL? IS THAT CORRECT OR DO THEY NOT  GET THE BENEFIT AT ALL OF THE  WAIVER ONCE IT SURPASSES 110  PERCENT. >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION  AND I THINK IT'S BETTER  ANSWERED BY SOMEBODY FROM  BUILDING AND SAFETY. I BELIEVE SOMEBODY IS HERE FROM  BUILDING AND SAFETY. Anime. The anime isCOUNCILMEMBE  PLEASE REPEAT THE QUESTION. >> A. Nazarian: THANK YOU FOR  BEING HERE AND MAKING YOURSELF  AVAILABLE. SO IF TODAY, THE BUDGET AND  FINANCE PROPOSAL THAT LIMITS  THE FEE WAIVER TO 110 PERCENT,  MOVES FORWARD AND THAT'S WHAT  IS ADOPTED MOVING FORWARD, AND  A PROPERTY OWNER WHO OWNED A  PROPERTY PRIOR TO JANUARY 7th,  DECIDES TO BUILD SOMETHING UP  TO 110 PERCENT, 130 PERCENT,  ABOVE AND BEYOND, SLIGHTLY  ABOVE THE 110 PERCENT LIMIT. DO THEY GET THEIR FEES WAVED? DO THEY GET THEIR FEES 110 PERC? OF THE NEW CONSTRUCTION? AND ONLY PAY THE REMAINING FEES  FOR 10 PERCENT OVERAGE? OR, OR, DO THEY UNDER THIS  PROPOSAL, NOT GET ANY WAIVERS  BECAUSE IT SURPASSED THE 110  PERCENT LIMIT? >> I BELIEVE THAT WILL BE  DEPENDENT ON HOW THE ORDINANCE  IS WRITTEN. IF IT'S 110 PERCENT, YOU GET IT  WAVED, BUT IF YOU GO PAST THE  110, IT CALCULATES ALL THE  IMPACT FEES, FOR EXAMPLE THE  LINKAGE FEES THE ARTS AND  DEVELOPMENT FEES AND THE LAUSD  FEES. NOW, WITH THOSE, I THINK THERE  WAS A CONVERSATION ABOUT WAVING  THOSE FEES, AT ONE POINT OF  BUDGET AND FINANCE, BUT I WAS  NOT SURE IF IT WAS ADDED INTO  THE INSTRUCTION. BUT IT'S NOT, FOR US IT'S NOT  CLEAR IF THEY, TO BE QUITE  HONEST, IT'S NOT CLEAR FOR US  ALSO IF THEY GET THE BENEFIT OF  THE 110 PERMIT FEES BEING  WAIVED AND ONLY WAY FOR THE  DIFFERENCE. IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US ALSO AS A  DEPARTMENT. >> KEN FONG CITY ATTORNEY'S  OFFICE, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT  YOU ADD ADDITION BECAUSE THE WAY THE  INSTRUCTIONS ARE WRITTEN, IT  SAYS UP TO 110 PERCENT SO  LOOKING AT THAT AT FACE VALUE,  YOU WOULD EXEMPT THOSE  PROPERTIES BUT IF YOU WANT TO  GIVE, A PRO RA AT THAT OF 110  PERCENT. DECIDES TO BUILD  MORE THAN THAT, THEY SHOULD NOT  BE PENALIZED FOR NOT GETTING  THE WAIVER OF UP TO 110 PERCENT. I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. TO MY COLLEAGUE IN DISTRICT 11,  IF THAT'S AMENABLE. >> Council President: OKAY,  WORKS OUT BECAUSE COUNCILMEMBER  PARK IS THE NEXT PERSON ON THE  QUEUE. >> T. Park: THANK YOU, AND WE  APPRECIATE THE ACCOMMODATION  SFRA TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. AS YOU CAN THIS IS A  CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR  SO MANY PEOPLE. COLLEAGUES JUST A BASIC  REMINDER, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING,  NOTHING ABOUT THIS REBUILT IS  VOLUNTARY. NOT FOR ANYONE WHO LOST THEIR  HOME OR THEIR PROPERTY, ON  JANUARY , IT DOES NOT MATTER,  WHETHER IT WAS A HOME, RENTED  OR OWNED. OR  Absolutamente nada. On January seventh, their entire show was taken from their homes, their churches, their schools. Memories. Their future. Recuerdos Sus futuros. Todo in a catastrophe that was known fault of their own. People survived terrifying evacuation. Sobrevivir sobrevivir en evacuations and everything they knew and loved. Mirando todo es conocian y todo lo querian jamas . Literally no one estos son modelos voluntarios literally nadie pidio. Son personas tratando de reconstruir para rebuild their lives. Tratando de reconstruir sus vidas milhares de aquellos and uninsured again through no fault of their own. Hundreds of them. Those days before the fire Los Dejaron. These are people who are incendios personas luchando con naciones. Sobre qué hacer ahora ? Estas son personas. A total loss and. De qué es una pérdida total y they are running out of acabando expenses are about to expire. Gastos TWO MONTHS AGO A  THEY'RE ALSO PAYING AND I  PERSONALLY KNOW TOO MANY OF  THEM THAT ARE HOLDING ON BY A  THREAD. THESE ARE, TEACHERS, ARTIST,  AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AN NURSES AND BUILDERS AND OFFICE  WORKERS JUST LIKE ALL THE REST  OF US ALL OVER L.A. SOME OF THEM, ARE GRANDPARENTS,  SOME OF THEM ARE BRAND NEW  FAMILIES, JUST STARTING OUT. SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN THERE  FOR GENERATIONS. THESE PEOPLE ARE OUR FRIENDS. THESE ARE OUR NEIGHBORS. AND THEY ARE ANGELINOS. WE OWE IT TO THEM. TO TAKE CARE OF THEM, JUST  BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO  DO! AND WHILE I DO APPRECIATE THE  FISCAL CONCERNS RAISED BY THE  BFI AND ITS REPORT, RESTRICTING  THE FEE WAIVER TO SINGLE-FAMILY  HOMES AND DUPLEXES WHICH IS  CLEARLY WHAT THE REPORT DOES,  JUST REPEATS THE SAME  FALSEHOOD, THAT SOMEHOW THE  PACIFIC PALISADES IS JUST AN  ISLAND OF AFFLUENT, THE REALITY  IS, WHAT WE LOST IS SO MUCH  MORE IT IS RENT STABLELIZED  MOBILE HOME PARKS WHICH I HAVE  BEEN FIGHTING LIKE HELL TO HELP  REBUILD DESPITE HITTING ONE  CHALLENGE AFTER ANOTHER. DOZENS OF THEM WERE TOWN HOMES,  NEARLY 1,000 UNITS OF RSO  HOUSING, INCOME RESTRICTED  CONDOS FOR SENIORS, THIS IS THE  FORM OF HOUSING IN THE TRUEST  SENSE OF THE WORD. AND FOR SO MANY OF OLDER MODEST  SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES, 110 DOES  NOT MAKE SENSE. THE COSTS OF LABOR, AND  MATERIALS HAVING TO HIRE  ARCHITECTS AND BUILDERS, THESE  PEOPLE JUST EVERYTHING. AND UNLIKE THE BUDGET AND  COMMITTEE REPORT, OUR REPORT  FROM THE RECOVERY COMMITTEE  CAPTURES THE BREATH OF THE  HOUSING STOCK AND MORE THAT WAS  LOST OR DAMAGED IN THE  PALISADES FIRE. WE SHOULD NOT PICKING WINNERS  AND LOSERS! TELLING ONE CLASS OF RESIDENTS,  THAT WE'LL WAIVE YOUR FEES IF  YOU OWN A SINGLE-FAMILY HOME,  WHILE WE WAIVE YOUR FEES IF YOU  OWN A DUPLEX. BUT WE'RE GOING TO TELL OTHER  PEOPLE, TOO BAD YOU OWN A  MOBILE HOME OR A CONNED DO. TOO BAD YOUR PROPERTY WAS A  MULTI FAMILY. TOO BAD YOU LIVED IN THE ADU IN  THE BACK OF A MAIN HOUSE. TOO BAD YOU OWNED A BUILDING ON  SUNSET BOULEVARD IN THE  HISTORIC BLOCK, BUSINESSES THAT  HAVE SERVED GENERATIONS OF  ANGELINOS. AND WORSE I CANNOT FIND A GOOD  REASON FOR THE DISTINCTION,  IT'S NOT THE FISCAL IMPACT OF  REBUILDING ON MULTI FAMILY OR  COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IS ANY  GREATER ACCORDING TO THE CAO'S  OWN REPORT, WAIVERS WOULD BE  LESS THAN SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES. AND MAYBE IN THE GRAND SCHEME  OF THINGS, IT DOESN'T FEEL  LIKE, WAIVING THESE FEES IS  ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REBUILDING  AND GIVING THESE FOLKS A  PATHWAY HOME. BUT FOR THEM, WHO ARE MAKING  DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER THEY  CAN RETURN OR IF THEY'RE JUST  GOING TO PACK UP AND LEAVE L.A.  FOREVER, FOR TO US SHOW THEM  THAT WE HAVE NR BACK, IT MIGHT  JUST BE ENOUGH. ENOUGH TO CONVINCE A RETIREE TO  STAY AND REBUILD, MAYBE IT WILL  BE ENOUGH CONVINCE AN APARTMENT  OWN TORE REBUILD SO THE PEOPLE  WHO ARE THERE HAVE AN  OPPORTUNITY TO COME HOME TO. COLLEAGUES, I THINK THE ONLY  THING THAT WE REALLY CAN DO  HERE, IS TO STAND UP AND FOR  THESE VICTIMS, VICTIMS WHO  THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN,  HAVE HAD EVERYTHING STOLEN FROM  THEM IN THIS CATASTROPHE. WE HAVE PRECEDENCE FOR DOING  THIS AND MY ASK TO YOU ALL, IS  THAT WE DO THE RIGHT THING D  WE ADOPT THE AD HOC COMMITTEE  REPORT. I WILL LIKE TO ASK, WHEN WE  TAKE THE VOTE, CAUSE I DON'T  KNOW, WHERE THE NUMBERS ARE  GOING TO COME, IF THIS IS GOING  TO BE LIMITED AND IF THE BFI  REPORT IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE  MOVED, I WOULD ASK WOULD YOU  PLEASE AT LEAST PLEASE,  CONSIDER A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT  THAT WOULD DO THE FOLLOWING. INCLUDE A SUNSET DATE, JANUARY  7, 2030. TWO, WAIVE REBUILDING FEES FOR  THE INELIGIBLE PROPERTY OWNERS  WHO'S FEES WERE ALREADY  SUSPENDED AS OF THE AFFECTIVE  DATE OF ORDINANCE. IF THOSE HOUSEHOLD FEES HAVE  ALREADY BEEN SUSPENDED, CITY OF  L.A. CAN'T BE A COLLECTION  AGENCY. COMMITTED WERE MADE TO ALL OF  THESE PEOPLE. AND THE MAYOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. 3, I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY  ESSENTIAL THAT THE WAIVER TO  LIKE FOR LIKE REBUILD, BE  EXPANDED TO INCLUDE CONDOS,  TOWN HOMES, APARTMENTS, AND OUR  MOBILE HOME PARKS. [APPLAUSE] 4, WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE 110  PERCENT, REBUILD RESTRICTION  FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES AND  DUPLEXES, FOR THE ECONOMIC  FACTORS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED. AND FINALLY FOR ALL PROPERTIES  UP TO 110 PERCENT, SHOULD BE  WAVED BEFORE ANY FEES ARE  CHARGED BEYOND THE 110 PERCENT. THANK YOU, COLLEAGUES. [APPLAUSE] . >> Clerk: IS THERE A SECOND TO  MS. PARK'S AMENDMENT? >> Council President: I HAVE  COUNCILMEMBER BLUMENFIELD ON  THE QUEUE. >> B. Blumenfield: I HAVE A  QUESTION, IS THERE ANY COST  ESTIMATE IN TERMS OF THE PRO RA  TA, WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IT'S  GOING COST US 86 MILLION, IF  IT'S 110 PERCENT. IF IT'S PRO RATA, IF YOU BUILD  ABOVE THE 110 PERCENT,  We haven't run that estimate. It was just up to 110 and there's no limit. But the 110 was. Was based on the assumption that it was 110 or bust. Right Right. Right. So the no limit was a SO THE NO LIMIT WAS 278, THAT'S  A ROUGH ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE. BUT WE HAVE NOT AN ESTIMATE IF  YOU THE  PROPERTIES THAT GO, YOU KNOW,  TO 150 AND WHAT THAT THE COST  WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE ON THAT. WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT TYPE OF  ESTIMATE, BUT IN MY CASE, IT  COULD BE UP TO 278. >> B. Blumenfield: OKAY, I  THINK IT'S A REASONABLE IDEA,  I' GET A SENSE,  EYES WIDE OPEN, WHAT IS THIS  GOING TO COST US? >> ALL WE CAN GIVE YOU AT THIS  POINT, IS THAT IT COULD BE A  RANGE BETWEEN 86 AND 278, IT'S  HARD TO KNOW WHO WOULD BUILD  BEYOND 110 PERCENT. >> Council President: LOOK IT  APPEARS TO ME, THAT, IT I DON'T  WANT TO MAKE A JUDGMENT THAT IS  CRITICAL BUT TO ME  THAT A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS  HAVE COME UP TODAY, HAVE NOT  BEEN CALCULATED. WHEN YOU TELL ME IT'S BETWEEN  86 AND 278, IT HAS NOT BEEN VE . COUNCILMEMBER PARK PUT A NUMBER  OF THINGS ON THE TABLE THAT A  LOST US WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A  LOOK AT. I'M UNCOMFORTABLE LOOKING AT  THEM IF YOU CANNOT GIVE ME ANY  IDEA HOW MUCH THEY COST. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. AND SO, I GUESS, PERHAPS THIS  IS A CITY ATTORNEY QUESTION, IF  WE GET THIS DONE TODAY, IF THE  BUDGET AND FINANCE REPORT  PASSES TODAY AS COUNCILMEMBER  PARK SUGGESTED, IS THIS CLOSED? OR WE COME BACK AND SAY,  LET'S CONSIDER MOBILE HOMES AND  ALL THOSE THINGS? >> City Attorney: WELL YOU CAN  ALWAYS ADOPT AN ORDINANCE AND  LATER ON, YOU KNOW, AMEND IT. YOU CAN DO THAT. >> Council President: ALL RIGHT. >> JUST WANT TO CLARIFY,  COUNCIL PRESIDENT, THIS  ESTIMATE WAS BASED ON THE  NUMBER OF PROPERTIES DESTROYED  AND WORKING WITH BUILDING AND  SAFETY AS TO IF THOSE BUILD UP  TO THE ORIGINAL SIZE WHAT THAT  WOULD ROUGH ESTIMATE, IF ANYONE  BUILT BEYOND THAT, AGAIN IT'S  MORE OF AN ART THAN A SCIENCE  GIVEN THAT WE DON'T EXACTLY  WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO. >> Council President: SURE, I  HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT WE CAN DO  BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE  US, THAT'S JUST MY OPINION. COUNCILMEMBER NAZARIAN IS YOUR  HAND GOING UP? >> A. Nazarian: YES, THERE IS A  COUPLE OF SIDE CONVERSATIONS  HAPPENING, SO I DIDN'T HEAR IF  THAT WAS A MOTION BY COLLEAGUE  WAS PUTTING FORWARD? AND IF IT IS, I'M HAPPY TO  SECOND IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN  WRITING. BUT IT I THINK IT COVERED THE  TENANTS OF THE SAFEGUARD AND  PRO RATA ISSUE. I WOULD BE WILLING TO SUPPORT  THAT AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE US  TO SUPPORT THAT OUT TODAY AND  BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AT THE  ORDINANCE WHEN IT COMES BACK SO  WE'RE NOT LOSING MORE TIME. BUT >> Council President: GOT YOU. ALL RIGHT, COUNCILMEMBER PARK. >> T. Park: I'M HAPPY TO  CIRCULATE THAT IN WRITING AND  YES, IT WAS PROPOSED AS WHAT, I  HOPE WILL BE RECEIVED AS A  FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO THE BFI  REPORT. >> Council President: ALL RIGHT. I SEE NOBODY ELSE ON THE QUEUE. YOU CANNOT. COUNCILMEMBER, I'M SORRY MADAM  CLERK? WE'VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS IN  THE AIR, CAN YOU GIVE US  GUIDANCE ON WHAT IS BEFORE US  IN WHAT ORDER? >> Clerk: YES, SO THE RIGHT  NOW, THERE IS AN AMENDMENT TO  THE BUDGET AND FINANCE REPORT,  THAT WAS INTRODUCED BY  COUNCILMEMBER PARK, SECONDED BY  COUNCILMEMBER NAZARIAN. AND THE AMENDMENT COVERS  VARIOUS TOPICS INCLUDING A  SUNSET DATE AND AMONG OTHER  THINGS. SO, THAT WOULD BE THE IMMEDIATE  VOTE. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, COUNCILMEMBER McOSKER? >> T. McOsker: THANK YOU VERY  MUCH. I THINK THERE IS A LOST --A LOT  OF VALUE IN THE AMENDMENT. BUT GOING TO THE COUNCIL  PRESIDENT'S WORDS, I WOULD  TO HEAR WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE. I THINK WE DO HAVE AN  OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE  ARE SPENDING GENERAL FUND  DOLLARS TO  RELIEVE THIS CRISIS. AND I THINK IT'S ARTFULLY  CRAFTED BUT I WOULD LIKE TO  KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER IS. I WOULD PROPOSE THAT WE TAKE  THIS INTO BUDGET AND FINANCE  AND GET AN AN Thank you, Council president. I agree with Mr. McCosker. You know, this isn't funny. Money. It's not theoretical money. And we're going to have to do a budget in the spring that is going to take into account general funds shifts that we're going to have to make. We don't know how much it's going to be. And there was a lot to Councilman Parks proposed amendment. And I would like to before we vote on an amendment, understand what the fiscal implications of that is at a moment when we are after our first officer, at least $80 million in the hole for this fiscal year. I don't think it's responsible for us to vote on things when we don't know what the fiscal impact of that is. So I agree with Mr. McCosker that that amendment should come back to budget and finance. I also am not opposed to voting today on the underlying budget and finance report. And then hearing in the next possible. I commit to Councilman Park that we will hear at the next possible budget and Finance committee meeting once that park given to us from the CFO and we can layer back in additional exemptions. We're talking about a couple of weeks. We're not talking about months. I don't feel comfortable as budget chair moving an amendment that I don't know what the intent. All right. So Aprobar una modification sobre Los efectos. The last amendment was made by council member Perkins. La ultima modification de la Park con las cinco Dakota. As of that motion. Are you comfortable with it going to be at the next available? Con regresar este esta modification o quieren votar ya, senor Presidente, estas personas tienen meses. Esperando esta. Incertidumbre. Were already made to these folks by the mayor months ago. It has taken us weeks and months to get us here. So I understand. Para para este acaso Enviado said, is wrong in fact, it has a head scratcher to me that we are sitting here today without the numbers and not having taken into the number of properties that are cuenta numero de propriedades q las cuales son las propiedades. Frankly, I'm a participar that we have as many questions as we have to do, and we couldn't even get an accurate answer when we say respuesta correcta. So theoretically I am not opposed to sending it because it is this important. I need a commitment that it's going to come back fast. We will. I think the committee chair is committed to that, and I'm committed to that. As chair of this body, Councilmember Nazarian okay. All right. So we'll refer that to budget and finance, the committee, the written, um, the written amendment. Uh, Madam Clerk, what's next? Senora. Secretary the vote on the voter to actually next would be amendment 23. C and that was modification . Rodriguez Rodriguez, Yaroslavsky, and, um, can you just give us briefly what the content of that is? UN resumen de este contenido? Yes This. 2023 C it was mis stamped a because, uh, on the agenda 23 A is the ad hoc recovery report. 23 B is the Budget and Finance Committee report. So 23 C is really es para el informe del member Rodriguez Yaroslavsky amendment. So itZ-YAROSLAVSKY  AMENDMENT, SO IT'S STAMPED 23-A. BUT ANYWAY, THE AMENDMENT  REQUESTED THE CITY ATTORNEY TO  REVISE THE DRAFT ORDINANCE  DATED JUNE 20, 2025 TO INCLUDE  ANY PROPERTY OWNER WHO UTILIZED  THE FEE WAIVER BE REQUIRED TO  REIMBURSE THE CITY, THE FEE  WAIVER AMENDMENT IF THE  PROPERTY OWNERSHIP IS  TRANSFERRED WITHIN 60 MONTHS OF  COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION. >> Council President:  COUNCILMEMBER McOSKER? COUNCILMEMBER NAZARIAN? COUNCILMEMBER PARK? >> T. Park: JUST, COUNCIL  PRESIDENT IF WE'RE GOING TO  SEND THINGS BACK TO COMMITTEE,  IT ALL NEEDS TO GO TO COMMITTEE. WE CANNOT BE PIECE MEALING,  THIS NEEDS TO BE A  COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF RELIEF  FOR OUR DISASTER VICTIMS. I ASK THAT IT ALL GO TOGETHER  AN COME BACK TOGETHER. >> Council President: OKAY. MADAM CLERK, WHAT'S. >> Clerk: SO FOR THE RECORD,  23-C IS REFERRED TO BUDGET AND  FINANCE AND FOR CLARIFICATION,  IS THE WHOLE MATTER 23 REFERRED  TO BUDGET AND FINANCE COMMITTEE? OKAY. >> Council President: THAT'S  THE REQUEST. >> Clerk: OKAY THE 23, THE  ENTIRE MATTER IS REFERRED TO  BUDGET AND FINANCE COMMITTEE. >> Council President: MR.  BLUMENFIELD. >> B. Blumenfield: WHY DON'T WE  AT LEAST MOVE FORWARD ON THE  WAIVERS? >> Council President: I WOULD  SECOND THAT. >> B. Blumenfield: WE HAVE THE  AMENDMENT WHICH MAKE SENSE. THE BUDGET AND FINANCE REPORT. WE CAN DELAY IT BUT I THINK WE  NEED TO MOVE FORWARD ON  SOMETHING. >> CouncilPresident: YEAH, I  WOULD SAY MEMBERS, THE THING  THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE  UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT ON IS AT  LEAST WHAT IS IN THE BUDGET  COMMITTEE, I THINK THERE ARE A  LOT OF US THAT WANT TO ADD A  LOST DIFFERENT THINGS. BUT WE CAN DISPOSE OF THAT PART  OF IT TODAY. MADAM BUDGET CHAIR, I WILL  DIFFER TO YOU, BECAUSE THIS IS  YOUR COMMITTEE WORK THAT IS  GOING TO BE IMPACTED HERE. >> K. Yaroslavsky:  THANK YOU,  COUNCIL PRESIDENT. I THINK THAT'S FINE. WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON TODAY IS  ASKING OR DIRECTING THE CITY  ATTORNEY OFFICE TO DRAFT THE  ORDINANCE. SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM SOME  TIME TO DO ANYWAY. SO IF WE CAN HEAR THE  AMENDMENTS IN BUDGET AND  FINANCE AND GET SOME COST  ESTIMATE IN TERMS OF THE DELTA  ON TOP OF THE 86, THEN WE CAN  VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT IN A  COUPLE OF WEEKS AND THAT CAN  INFORM THE DRAFTING. I DON'T THINPROBLEM  IN TERMS OF TIMING. THEY CAN GET STARTED IF WE VOTE  ON IT TODAY. >> Council President: OKAY, MR.  McOSKER, COUNCILMEMBER PARK? >> T. Park: COUNCILMEMBER  YAROSLAVSKY, BUT THEN AREN'T WE  GIVING INCOMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS,  AND THEN AMENDED AND SLOW  EVERYTHING SLOW DOWN AGAIN AND  AGAIN. WAIT UNTIL JANUARY 7th. >> K. Yaroslavsky: DO YOU WANT  TO SEND IT ALL BACK TO  COMMITTEE? THAT'S FINE. >> T. Park: YES. >> K. Yaroslavsky: IN THE  MEANTIME, NOBODY IS PAYING ANY  FEES AND NOBODY HAS THAT  CERTAINITY. I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY. SO THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR  NOT YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME  CERTAINITY AND SOME PARAMETERS  ABOUT SOME OF THE UNIVERSE THAT  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S A QUESTION FOR YOU,  COUNCILWOMAN, DO YOU WANT SOME  CERTAINITY AND THEN WE PAY  ADDITIONAL. >> T. Park: BECAUSE WE'RE NOT  COLLECT THE FEES, I WANT TO  HAVE COMPLETE INFORMATION AND  COSTA NAL SIS THAT LOOKS AT THE  VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES THAT WE'VE  INCLUDED SO WE CAN ASSESS A  COMPLETE PICTURE AND THEN GIVE  CLEAR DIRECTION TO THE CITY  ATTORNEY AND GET ONE ORDINANCE  BACK, ONE TIME AND SEND IT  THOSE FOLKS ON THEIR WAY. >> K. Yaroslavsky: EXCELLENT. GOING BACK TO COMMITTEE. >> Council President: OKAY, I  SEE A LOT OF THUMBS UP AND  NOBODY ON QUEUE. MADAM CLERK, WHAT IS BEFORE US. >> Clerk: SO THE ENTIRE MATTER  23 IS REFERRED TO BUDGET AND  FINANCE COMMITTEE. SO COUNCIL NEXT ITEM IS 24 AND  THAT WAS CALLED SPECIAL BY AN  AMENDMENT AND THAT IS AMENDMENT  SOTO-MARTINEZ-HERNANDEZ. >> Council President: ALL RIGHT. COUNCILMEMBER SOTO-MARTINEZ? >> H. Soto-Martinez: OH MY GOD. THANK YOU SO MUCH. COUNCIL PRESIDENT, IT'S BEEN A  LONG DAY, I APPRECIATE EVERY  ONE'S PATIENCE. I SUBMITTED AN AMENDMENT TO  ITEM 24-A, THAT I THINK IS  IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD ALL  THINK ABOUT. BECAUSE IN ITEM IS ABOUT THE  CITY COMPLYING WITH AB481 A LAW  THAT WAS PASSED BY THE GEORGE  FLOYD UPRISING. AND IF YOU REMEMBER AT THE  TIME, THERE WAS A HUGE OUTCRY  ABOUT MULT REEQUIPMENT IN  RESPONSE TO THE PROTEST. TO REMEDY THE STATE PASSED A  B481 WHICH SAYS WE'RE REQUIRED  TO REVIEW THE USE AND APPROVE  ONLY IF LEGAL STANDARDS HAVE  BEEN MET. IF ALL THE FOLLOWING ARE TRUE. ONE, THAT THERE IS NO  REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE TO  ACHIEVE OFFICER AND CIVILIAN  SAFETY. TWO THAT THE SAFEGUARD AND  CIVIL LIBERTY AND THREE THAT  PRIOR USE IS COMPLIED WITH THE  MILITARY EQUIPMENT USED POLICY  AND THEY DID NOT, THEN  CORRECTIVE ACTION HAS BEEN  TAKEN. IF ONE OF THESE STANDARDS HAVE  NOT BEEN MET, WE HAVE A DUTY TO  WITHHOLD THAT APPROVAL. NOW OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS,  WE'VE SEEN VERIFIED EQUIPMENT  IN WAY THAT'S SHOULD BE MAKE  EVERY ONE HERE IN THIS BODY  PAWS. A 40-MILLIMETER SHOT AT  PEACEFUL PROTEST EXERCISING  THEIR RIGHTS, UNLIKE ANYTHING  WE'VE SEEN IN DECADES AND IN  ONE SINGLE DAY, ON JUNE 8th,  ACCORDING TO A B48 REPORT WHICH  IS A SEPARATE LAW, WE SAW OVER  1,000 PROJECTILES FILED AT  ABOUT 6,000 PEOPLE INCLUDING 20  ROUNDS OF CHEMICAL AGENTS. IN RESENT MONTHS, WE'VE WATCHED  THIS EQUIPMENT DEPLOYED IN  WEAKEN TACTICS WE CONDEMN IN  RAIDS. OUR RESIDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO  EXPRESS THEIR RIGHTS WITHOUT  BEING MET WITH RUBBER BULLETS  OR TEAR GAS. THIS IS NOT A RESPONSE TO FEW  BAD ACTORS. NOW IN PUBLIC SAFETY REPORT,  THERE WERE MANY TYPES OF  EQUIPMENT THAT CLEARLY SERVE  LEGITIMATE PURPOSES IN THE  CITY, SPECIALIZED TOOLS FOR  BOMB SQUADS, ESTIMATES USED TO  SAVE LIVES, BUT AB481 BECAUSE  NOT SAY THAT WE HAVE TO APPROVE  EVERYTHING OR NOTHING. WHEN ONE CATEGORY FAILS TO MEET  THE STATUTORY STANDARDS, WE'RE  REQUIRED TO VOTE NO. ONLY RESTRICT 40 MILLIMETERS  PROJECTILES AND TEAR GAS, TWO  PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT WE'VE  SEEN WIDELY ABUSED. COLLEAGUES, A B481 WAS PASSED  IN A MOMENT IN HISTORY THAT  DECIDED THAT WE WERE MAKING  PROGRESS HOW WE POLICE. MY AMENDMENT IS ABOUT FOLLOWING  THE LAW, PROTECTING CIVIL  LIBERTIES AND ENSURING THAT  EQUIPMENT IS USED ONLY WHEN  NECESSARY WITH THE VALUES OF  THE CITY. I'M URGING THIS COUNCIL TO NOT  GO BACKWARDS AND THAT'S WHY I'M  ASKING FOR A YES-VOTE THAT IS  NARROWLY TAYLORED UNTIL WE CAN  FIND OUT ABOUT HOW THIS IS  BEING USED IN OUR CITY STREETS. I URGE A YES-VOTE ON A B481. >> Council President:  COUNCILMEMBER LEE. >> J. Lee: THANK YOU, MR.  PRESIDENT. IT'S ALWAYS MY FEAR WHEN WE  TALK ABOUT LIMITING NON LETHAL  MUNITION THAT OUR OFFICERS WHEN  PUT IN HARM'S WAY, DON'T HAVE  ALTERNATIVES TO TURN TO,  BESIDES LETHAL. WHICH IS NONE OF US WANT. I BELIEVE THE CHIEF IS HERE,  CHIEF DO YOU MIND AND CITY  ATTORNEY JOIN US AT THE TABLE.D. >> J. Lee: THANK YOU, CHIEF FOR  JOINING US. WHAT OPERATIONAL IMPACT WOULD  THIS HAVE TO LAPD TO REMOVE  THESE TWO ITEMS? IF YOU CAN GIVE US AN  EXPLANATION OR MAYBE ALSO,  INSTANCES WHERE WE'VE HAD TO  USE THEM. >> YEAH, I LOOK AT THIS AND TO  ME, THIS IS AMAZING THAT WE  WOULD BE ENTERTAINING. A 40-METER PROJECTILE HAVE USED  EVERY DAY TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE  WEAPONS AND COMING AT OUR  OFFICERS AND  OUR  RESIDENT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT  THEM. IT'S A DEESCALATION TOOL, SHORT  OF USING DEADLY FORCE. THE LAST THING WE WANT TO USE  IS DEADLY FORCE. TAKING A TOOL AWAY FROM US,  PUTS US IN A BAD POSITION  RELATIVE TO CITY LIABILITY, AND  RELATIVE TO PROTECTING OUR  OFFICERS, AND THE PUBLIC THAT  WE SERVE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE  GONG DOWN THIS ROAD TO BE VERY  HONEST AND GAS, THAT YOU ALSO  PUT IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL. GAS WAS USED IN JUNE AT A POINT  WHERE, PROTESTERS HAD TAKEN  DOWN ANNINGS, BACKED THEM UP  WITH WATER BERRIES AND USING P  B.C. TO SHOOT COMMERCIAL GRADE  TO AT OFFICERS, THAT'S DEADLY  FORCE. WE TRY TO USE LESS LETHAL,  OTHER TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO STOP  THAT ASSAULT, IT WAS NOT  AFFECTIVE. AND SO IN AN EFFORT TO  DEESCALATION, CHEMICAL AGENT  WAS DEPLOYED AND EXTREMELY  AFFECTIVE AND PREVENTED THINGS  THAT NONE OF US WOULD WANT  HAPPEN THAT DAY HAPPEN. SO WHEN I LOOK AT THIS, IT'S MY  HOPE IS, THAT WE HAVE AN  OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE NEXT  TIME TO EDUCATE MEMBERS OF THE  COUNCIL, MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC,  AS TO WHAT THESE TOOLS DO AND  WHAT THEY DON'T DO, RATHER THAN  BE SWAYED BY EMOTION OR SWAYED  BY THE LOUD VOICES OF A  RELATIVE FEW, WE'RE HERE TO  PROTECT 40 MILLION RESIDENTS OF  LOS ANGELES AND VISITORS. SER WE'RE GOING INTO THE WORLD  CUP AND O LIMB --OLYMPICS AND  PARAOLYMPICS TO TAKE A  DEESCALATION TOOLS, TO ME IS A  HEAD SCRATCHER. >> Council President: ANYTHING  ELSE? >> J. Lee: CHIEF, IF I KNOW,  YOU HAVE THE CITY ATTORNEY, I  WAS WONDERING IF THEY CAN WEIGH  IN ON THIS ISSUE AT ALL? >> YEAH, IF I COULD BEFORE. MY ASK AND THAT'S REALLY WHY  I'M HERE, THAT HAD YOU GIVE  CONSIDERABLE THOUGHT TO THIS  ITEM AND AWE PROOF AL THE  RENEWAL OF ORDINANCE WITHOUT  THAT AMENDMENT, THIS HAS TO BE  COMPLETED OR WE LOSE THE  ABILITY TO DEPLOY THE EQUIPMENT  THAT TO THE PUBLIC, THAT HAS  NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO READ. COVERED BY A B481 INCLUDES ALL  ARMOR VEHICLES SO OUR BEAR CATS  THAT WE USE EVERY SINGLE DAY TO  FUT THIS TOOL BETWEEN THE  PUBLIC AND SUSPECT AND DEADLY  FIRE, IT SAVES LIVES BEYOND  WHAT I CAN DESCRIBE HERE. INTER IMMEDIATE YANS SUCH AS  THE BEAN BAG, THE 37  MILLIMETER, 40 AND 47 AND FOAM  PROJECT AISLES USED TO BE ABLE  TO DEESCALATE A SITUATION SHORT  OF DEADLY FORCE. AND DEADLY TRAILERS WHICH WE  GLOID TO SPORTING EVENTS AND  COMMUNITY EVENTS, AND AGAIN WE  HAVE THESE MAJOR EVENTS  WORLDWIDE EVENTS COMING TO LOS  ANGELES IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF  YEARS. THE 40 MILLIMETER GIVES US A  TOOL TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WITH  EDGE WEAPON, WE USE IT IN CROWD  CONTROL BUT TARGETED FOR  BEHAVIOR AND IT'S TRULY A DE  ESCALATION TOOL. AND THE UNREST WE SAW IN JUNE. WE'RE ASKING OUR POLICETO DO  AN INCREDIBLY JOB WITH FEW JOBS  AND NOW WE'RE LOOKING TO TAKE  AWAY TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE AT  THEIR DISPOSAL. THIS IS INCREDIBLY--TO GO DOWN  THIS ROAD. TO ME IT'S SHORT-SIDED.IS NO  OTHER CITY IN CALIFORNIA THAT  THEIR TACTICAL OPTIONS LIMITED  BY A BODY SUCH AS THIS. I HAVE  NOT SEEN IT YE. TAKING AWAY  LESS LETHAL USE, AND REDUCING  TACTICAL OPTIONS WILL RESULT  ANYONE CREASED LIABILITY FOR  THE CITY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY  ADDITIONAL RISK FOR OFFICERS  AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ALIKE. THE SUPPLEMENTAL AMENDMENT  WOULD BE DESTRIMENTED TO THE  RESIDENTS OF L.A. WHO RELY ON  LAPD TO PROTECT THEIR LIVES. LAPD OFFICERS WILL ALWAYS PUT  THEMSELVES IN HARMS WAY, FROM  WHERE I SIT IS  UNCONSIDERATIONABLE. >> Council President: THANK  YOU, CHIEF. MR. LEE, I JUST WANTED WRAP UP. WE'RE  ALMOST AT TIME. >>  Lee: YES, COLLEAGUES,  WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE AWAY A TOOL  FROM LAPD WHEN NAIR PUT INTO  SITUATIONS WHERE WE DON'T WANT  THEM TO HAVE LETHAL FORCED TO  TURN TO. WE DON'T WANT THEM TO TURN TO  THEIR SIDE ARM WHEN SOMEBODY IS  COMING AT THEM WITH A KNIFE OR  OBJECT. THESE ARE TOOLS YOU USE. IN SITUATIONS LIKE THE ONE IN  JUNE, WHERE THEY'RE, WHERE  THEY'RE BEING COMMERCIAL GRADE  FIREWORKS SHOT AT THEM? WHAT DO THE OFFICERS TURN TO  OTHER THAN THAT USE OF LETHAL  FORCED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES  FROM BODILY HARM AND THAT'S  WHEN THEY USE. I KNOW THAT THE LAPD DOES NOT  JUST USE GAS WHENEVER THE  SITUATION, THE ONLY WHEN THE  SITUATION WARRANTS IT. I HOPE BEFORE YOU VOTE, YOU  REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE  DOING HERE. IF WE ARE LIMITING LAPD'S  ABILITY TO RESPOND TO KEEP NOT  ONLY ANGELINOS SAFE BUT TO KEEP  OUR OFFICERS SAFE AS WELL. AND I URGE A NO-VOTE AGAINST  THE AMENDMENT AND YES ON THE  OVERALL ITEM. >> Council President: THANK  YOU, MR. LEE. COUNCILMEMBER JURADO? COUNCILMEMBER HERNANDEZ? >> E. Hernandez: THANK YOU,  CHIEF FIRST AND FOR MOST, I  RECOGNIZE THE GOAL THE  DEPARTMENT WANTS TO ACHIEVE  WITH CROWD CONTROL, AND AT THE  SAME TIME, I HAVE GREAT CONCERN  OF CS GAS BECAUSE THE WELL  DOCUMENTED ABOUT THE AFFECTS ON  PEOPLE INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE  IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS, I'LL  TRY TO GO THROUGH THEM AS  QUICKLY. TEAR GAS IS BAND UNDER THE  GENEVA CONVENTIONS BECAUSE OF  ITS ABILITY TO CAUSE CHEMICAL  BURNS AND BREATHING FAILURE. IF IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO USE ON  ENEMY COMBATANTS CAN YOU  EXPLAIN WHY IT'S EASIER. >> CS GAS IS DIFFERENT FROM  WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING. IT'S GENERALLY ACCEPTED CROWD  CONTROL TOOL, WE USE IT ONLY AS  A LAST RESORT TO RESTORE ORDER. PEOPLE IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT  DISBURSAL, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN  GIVEN TIME TO LEAVE THE AREA  AND WE DO IT OVER AND OVER  AGAIN, AND SOMETIMES IN  MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO  LEAVE THAT ENVIRONMENT. ONLY WHEN OFFICERS AND OTHER  PEOPLE IN THE ENVIRONMENT ARE  BEING VIOLENTLY ASSAULTED WILL  WE CONSIDER THE USE OF  SOMETHING LIKE CHEMICAL  DISBURSAL AGENCY. >> E. Hernandez: THANK YOU, I  WILL SAY SOMETIMES THOSE  MOMENTS HAPPEN QUICKLY. I WAS AT ONE OF THE PROTEST  WATCHING WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND  DISBURSAL ORDER CAME IN AND IT  WAS NOT CLEAR BUT THEY HAD  EVERYBODY RUNNING BY THEM LAPD  IN THE AREA. I KNOW THERE IS A LOT ON WORK  IT. NUMBER 2, TEAR GAS CARRIES INTO  HOMES AND BUSINESSES WHAT IS  LAPD SCIENTIFIC FOR CLAIMING  YOU CAN DEPLOY CHEMICAL WEAPON  IN DENSE NEIGHBORS LIKE OURS. >> WE ONLY DO IT WHEN OUR  OFFICERS AND PUBLIC IS BEING  ASSAULTED. >> THEN IT'S NOT A DE  ESCALATION. IT'S A CROWD MOVING TACTIC? RIGHT. >> IT'S A DEESCALATION TACTIC  AFTER THEY'VE BEEN ORDERED TO  LEAVE THE ENVIRONMENT AND  CONTINUE TO MOVE. WE WOULD NOT USE IF THEY MOVED  OUT OF THERE. >> E. Hernandez: UNDERSTOOD,  BUT I WANT TO BE CAREFUL ON HOW  WE USE DEESCALATION, IT'S TO  REDUCE THE TENSION OF A  SITUATION BUT, TEAR GAS IS NOT,  REDUCING HARM, IT'S INFLICTING  MORE HARM. AND ALSO, THE RUBBER BULLETS,  THOSE ARE INFLICTING MORE HARM. I'VE SEEN CASES WHERE PEOPLE'S  TESTICLES HAVE BEEN BLOWN UP. --BLOWN OFF. >> IT'S SERIOUS BUT WE USE IT  AS DEESCALATION TOOL. THE DETERRENT IS NOT WANT TO GO  TO AS A CITY. >> E. Hernandez: I WOULD SAY  IT'S A CROWD CONTROL TOOL NOT  DEESCALATION. >> HERE'S DEADLY FORCE, HERE IS  LESS LETHAL FORCE. >> E. Hernandez: THAT'S USING A  DIFFERENT TOOL. >> E. Hernandez: DEESCALATION  YOU'RE TRAINED, SO THERE IS A  TACTIC, IT'S A WORK OF ART,  WHAT YOU'RE USING A GUN THAT  CAN KILL SOMEBODY, VERSUS A  DIFFERENT DIFFICULT. >> THE RESULT IS DIFFERENT,  THAT'S WHY WE USE IT BECAUSE IT  DEESCALATION THE SITUATION  WHERE YOU'RE NOT USING A  HIGH-LEVEL OF FORCE. >> E. Hernandez: WE CAN AGREE  TO DISAGREE. NUMBER 3,  I WANT TO I  UNDERSTAND WHY IT CAN--PLEASE  WALK US THROUGH THIS IN DETAIL. WHAT SPECIFIC PUBLIC SAFETY  OUTCOMES BECOME IMPOSSIBLE IF  THESE WEAPONS ARE NO LONGER  AUTHORIZED? CAN YOUR DEPARTMENT NO LONGER  PERFORM WITH TOOLS THAT ARE  INTERNATIONAL BANNED IN WARFARE. >> SO YOU'RE TALKING THE 40 AND  GAS OR EVERYTHING IN 481. >> 40 AND THE GAS. >> OKAY, BOTTOM LINE, IF YOU  TAKE LESS AWAY LETHAL TOOLS  WHAT ALTERNATIVES ARE LEFT FOR  THE OFFICERS TO PROTECT  THEMSELVES AND THE PUBLIC. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE LOOKED  AT AT THE SITUATION FROM THE  OFFICER' STAND POINT. THEY TRY AND I TELL YOU, DURING  THE RESENT UNREST IN JUNE, THE  LEVEL OF RESILIENCE, THEIR  ABILITY TO WITHSTAND WHAT THEY  WERE DOING, WAS ADD MEASURABLE. AND I LOOK AT THE WORK THAT WAS  DONE OUT THERE, WE HAVE BECOME  A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE  COUNTRY FOR HANDLING CROWD  MANAGEMENT. WE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. WE DON'T DEPLOY ANY TOOL TACTIC  WITHOUT TAKING CONSIDERATION. I WOULD INVITE YOU TO GET  EDUCATED ON WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT  TO VOTE ON. I HAVE A STANDING INVITATION  FOR A RIDE ALONG. >> E. Hernandez: THANK YOU FOR  THAT OPPORTUNITY. NOW, MY ASK WAS ABOUT ANY DATA,  DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA? AND ALSO CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US >> DATA ON WHAT? >> ON THE ETHICACY THE TOOLS? >> RIGHT NOW? >> >> E. Hernandez: YOU CAN COME  BACK. >> I'M HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOU  AND GIVE YOU WHATEVER DATA THAT  WE CAN PROVIDE THAT WOULD MAKE  SENSE. I CAN TELL YOU FROM AN  EXPERIENCED STAND POINT THAT  THE TOOLS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,  DEESCALATION A SITUATION AND  LIMIT ANY DAMAGE TO AN  INDIVIDUAL AND THAT  ENVIRONMENT, THAT'S THE REASON  WE USE THEM. THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS  USE DEADLY FORCE. SO THE AND LAST QUESTION, THANK  YOU, COUNCIL PRESIDENT. NOW, AFTER THE RAIDS, AFTER THE  FIRST FEW PROTESTS THAT WERE  OCCURRING SMFT US MET WITH THE  BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS AND THEY  TALKED ABOUT HOW THERE WAS OVER  60 CASES BEING IDENTIFIED OF  OVER USE OF FORCE. WHEN YOU SAY THE TOOLS AND  WEAPONS ARE MODELS, THAT  CONCERNS ME BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT  TO START RECEIVING ALL OF THOSE  LAWSUITS. AND LAWSUIT PAY OUT FOR LAPD  ARE ONE OF THE HIGHEST. SO IF THE MODEL THAT PEOPLE ARE  MIRROR IS GOING TO COST THE  CITY BUDGET. >> YOU TALK ABOUT COMPLAINTS,  WE'RE AN ORGANIZATION THAT  TAES A COMPLAINT ANYTIME  ANYBODY TAKES AN ALLEGATION  MAYBE MISCONDUCT OR WORSE. WE TAKE EVERY COMPLAINT AND  INVESTIGATE IT FULLY. WE USE DO OF FORCE REVIEWS AND  INVESTIGATIONS AND THEN  ADJUDICATE THEM IN A WAY THAT  IS REPLICATED. AND WE HAVE BEEN THE MODEL FOR  ABOUT 22 YEARS. I TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY BECAUSE  WE ENSURE THAT DO THE BEST WE  CAN FOR THE RESIDENTS OF LOS  ANGELES. THAT IS RECOGNIZED BY OTHER  EXPERTS WHO LOOK AT THIS STUFF  EVERY DAY. AND I WOULD LOVE TO EDUCATE YOU  MORE THAN HAS BEEN DONE IN THE  PAST ABOUT THE ISSUES WE'RE  TALKING ABOUT TODAY. WE'RE TALKING LIFE OR DEATH  HERE ON THE DECISION YOU'RE  ABOUT TO MAKE. >> E. Hernandez: 100 PERCENT,  AND IT'S 2025 AND I'M SURE THAT  THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS THAT THEY  CAN USE. >> ARE YOU SURE? I'M HAPPY TO SHOW YOU WHAT ARE  AVAILABLE UP THERE. WE GO AND MEET WITH  MANUFACTURES AND VENDORS TO  LOOK WHAT IS OUT THERE, TO  EVOLVE TO BE BETTER THAN THAN  WE WERE YESTERDAY. WE'RE WELL AWARE AND WE USE THE  TOOLS THAT WORK BEST TO TRY TO  ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT ARE SET  AND THAT IS TO PROVIDE THE  SAFEST CITY FOR THE RESIDENTS  OF LOS ANGELES THAT WE POSSIBLY  CAN. >> E. Hernandez: I HEAR YOU,  AND ALSO WE FEED TO BE FISCALLY  RESPONSIBLE AND IF THE TOOLS  THAT WE'RE USING ARE CAUSING  MORE FISCAL UNCERTAINITY, WE  NEED TO REFLECT AND THAT'S WHY  WE'RE ASKING FOR THIS MOTION. >> TO ME, I CAN'T PUT THOSE  TOGETHER. YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT A PRICE ON  SAVING LIVES, WE'RE SAVING  LIVES AND YES WE'RE GOING TO  GET LAWSUIT AND YES WE'RE GOING  TO COMPLAINT AND WE DEAL WITH  THE LAWSUIT BUT AT THE END OF  THE DAY, WE'RE TRYING TO  PROTECT PEOPLE AND OUR OFFICERS  AS WELL WE'RE IN THE SAFETY  BUSINESS. SO TO TRY TO TAKE AND TALK  ABOUT THE FISCAL REALITY THE  CITY IS FACING, TWO SEPARATE  CONVERSATIONS. >> E. Hernandez: IT'S NOT, I  SIT IN BUDGET AND FINANCE, WE  HAD THREE DIFFERENT CASES WHERE  IT WAS 10 MILLION DOLLARS FOR  EACH OF THOSE CASES. YOU CANNOT SEPARATE WHERE THE  TAX DOLLARS ARE DEALING WITH  THE LAWSUITS. >> YEAH, I UNDERSTAND THAT. >> Council President: THANK  YOU, COUNCILMEMBER HERNANDEZ. I'VE GOT COUNCILMEMBER  SOTO-MARTINEZ AND THEN WE WANT  TO BRING THERE ISSUE TO A  DECISION. >> H. Soto-Martinez: THANK YOU  SO MUCH. MR. PRESIDENT, I WANT TO BE  CLEAR TO MY COLLEAGUES, I THINK  THERE WAS A MISREPRESENTATION  OF WHAT TRIEM --TRYING TO  ACCOMPLISH HERE. AND EVEN IF WE WERE TO VOTE AND  AND TEAR GAS, POLICE OFFICERS  STILL HAVE FN303 DISTRACTION  DEVICES, AND PEPPER SPRAY. SO EVEN IF WE TAKE IT AWAY,  LET'S NOT FALL FOR THE ARGUMENT  THAT THEY HAVE NO TOOL. THE ISSUE I'M TRYING TO GET TO  IS HOW THIS CITY IS BEING  PERCEIVED IN THE MOMENT WHEN  THE FOLKS ARE TRYING TO PROTEST  AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THE  RISE OF FASCISM IN AMERICA AND  HOW WE AS A CITY ARE ACTING. AND THE TWO PLACES, CHIEF WHERE  I FIND ISSUE AND I MADE THIS  MANY TIMES IN THE LAST FEW  MONTHS IS HOW WE'RE USING THE  40 MILLIMETERS AND THE TEAR GAS. AND WHEN GUIDED WHETHER THIS IS  CORRECT OR INCORRECT I'M  LOOKING AT AB48 A LAW THAT WAS  PASSED THAT SAYS HOW WE USE  CONNETIC PROJECTILES, I KNOW  YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THIS, E  LAW LITERALLY THAT THESE CAN  ONLY BE USED WHEN DEESCALATION  TACTICS OR OTHER ALTERNATIVES  TO FORCE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED,  THIS IS NOT A DEESCALATION. >> IT'S A CONTINUANCE. >> I'M READING THE LAW. >> GO AHEAD. >> H. Soto-Martinez: SECOND OF  AWE, AB SAYS, USING  TARGET-SPECIFIC UP TO THE  POLICE OFFICER TO IDENTIFY THE  PERSON THAT IS CAUSING THE  SO-CALLED VIOLENCE AND THAT  THAT PERSON CAN BE HIT WITH THE  40-MILLIMETER PROJECTILE. I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT  ON JUNE 8th, WE SHOT OVER A  THOUSAND OF THESE PROJECTILES  TO 6,000 PEOPLE. THAT IS NOT TARGET SPECIFIC. MAKE NA ARGUMENT HOW IS  SHOOTING 8,000 PROJECTILES. >> YEAH,  QUOTING IS NOT 40 MILLIMETERS,  IT'S TOTAL, 37 MILLIMETER AND  40, YEAH, YOU MAY -- -- >> H. Soto-Martinez: ONE WAS  600 AND ONE WE CAN START  PARSING THE NUMBERS. TELL ME HOW WE'RE FOLLOWING A  B48. >> A LOST THOSE PROJECT AISLES  ARE NOT HITTING THEIR TARGET. AND YOU'RE IN  BUSINESS. WE INVITE YOU TO SEE THE VIDEO. THE SAFE GUARDS WE PUT IN PLACE  TO ENSUREFOLLOWING  THE LAW. WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN OUR  ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO OUR  JOB. SO FOR YOU, WITHOUT COMING TO  SEE WHAT WE DO TO MAKE SHE'S  CHALLENGES, I'M TROUBLED BY  THAT. >> H. Soto-Martinez: WELL I  THINK, I SPEAK FOR MANY PEOPLE  IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THAT  ARE TROUBLED BY THE WAY WE HAVE  BEEN RESPONDED TO PEACEFUL  PROTEST. AND I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT  VARIETY OF OPINIONS BUT I HAVE  TO SPEAK TO MY CONSTITUENTS THE  FOLKS THAT I TALK TO, WHO SAY  WHY IS LAPD ACTING LIKE THAT  AND IT'S A ERODE IN TRUST AND  OUR SYSTEM. THE OTHER PART OF AB48 THAT  SAYS, OFFICERS SHOULD MINIMIZE  THE POSSIBLE INCIDENTAL IMPACTS  OF THEIR USE OF CONNETIC IMPACT  TO JOURNALIST WHEN WE SEE ON  LIVE TELEVISION, A JOURNALIST  SHOT BY ANOTHER, APPEARS TO BE  A 40 MILLIMETER, I BELIEVE IT'S  A MILLIMETER, HOW CAN WE SEE  THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING A B48. >> HAPPY TO SHOW YOU THAT. IF YOU CARE TO SEE, I'M HAPPY  TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE HAVE ON  THAT. THERE IS MORE TO THAT STORY  THAN WHAT YOU PRESENTED HERE. WE DO NOT TARGET MEDIA. WE DO NOT TARGET POLICE  OFFICERS WHO ALSO GET HIT IN  THAT ENVIRONMENT. IT'S OFTEN VERY CHAOTIC AND A  LOST THINGS ARE GOING ON AT ONE. WE HAD 52 OFFICERS HURT IN JUNE. NOT A LOST TALK ABOUT THAT. THEY WERE THERE IN THAT  ENVIRONMENT AND SOME WERE HIT  WITH 40s AND SOME WITH 37 MS.,  NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE AIMED AT  BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THAT  ENVIRONMENT. >> H. Soto-Martinez: SO YOU  WHEN YOU, I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T  HAVE THIS DISCUSSION IN  COMMITTEE, MR. LEE. BUT AFTER, LOOKING MORE INTO IT  AND FOLKS COMING INTO THIS VOTE  WE LOOKED IT, AND I AS A  PERSON, HAVE TO TAKE A POSITION  AND SAY, DO  I BELIEVE THAT  THEY'RE USING THE 40 TEAR GAS  IN THE CORRECT WAY. MY ANSWER IS NO. YOU KNOW,  I DON'T THINK I'M  GOING TO BE IN THE MAJORITY BUT  WE HAVE TO HAVE THE  CONVERSATION. >> I'M  HAPPY TO HAVE THE  CONVERSATION. >> H. Soto-Martinez: I DO NOT  BELIEVE, IN THE INSTANCE THAT'S  I'VE SEEN AND REPORTING AND THE  LAWSUITS, NOW PILING UP, THAT  WE'RE USING THESE TWO PIECES OF  EQUIPMENT IN THE CORRECT WAY. >> OKAY. >> H. Soto-Martinez: I HOPE  FOLKS CAN SEE IT THAT WAY AND  VOTE YES IN AMENDMENT. AND LIMIT THE POLICE OFFICER  ABILITY IN SITUATIONS WHEN  THEY'RE CONFRONTED WITH  SOMEBODY WITH A WEAPON, I  MENTIONED ALL THE DIFFERENT  TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE. THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE, IT'S NOT  GOING TO GO AWAY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING  TO CONTINUE TO SNATCH PEOPLE  OFF THE STREET AND WE'RE GOING  TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION AS A  CITY HOW WE INTERACT ABOUT  PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHTFULLY UPSET. >> WE, WE OVERSEE, WE MANAGE  HUNDREDS OF PROTESTS A PEACEFUL  PROTEST WHERE THIS IS NOT AN  ISSUE. THE EXCEPTION IS WHEN WE HAVE  VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS, VIOLENT  ACTIONS, THAT'S WHERE WE TALK  ABOUT THESE TOOLS AT ALL. THE VAS MAJORITY OF  DEMONSTRATION THAT WE DEAL WITH  ACROSS THE YEAR ARE PEACEFUL,  WE MEET WITH THE ORGANIZERS, WE  HAVE NO ISSUES. >> H. Soto-Martinez: I AGREE  WITH THAT. MOST PROTEST ARE PEACEFUL. AND THE PROTEST THAT HAVE  MARSHALS, PEOPLE FROM THE  ORGANIZATION POLICING  THEMSELVES, ALMOST 100 HAVE NO  INCIDENT WHICH IS WHY I  INTRODUCED A MOTION TO TRY TO  CREATE THAT SYSTEM IN THE CITY. AND ALSO WHEN THERE IS  COORDINATION BETWEEN THE  ORGANIZERS OF THE MARCH AND  LAPD, USUALLY 100 PERCENT,  THERE IS NO INCIDENT. >> RIGHT. >> SO I AGREE THAT IT'S A VERY  SMALL NUMBER OF INCIDENTS WHERE  WHEN THIS HAPPENS. >> CORRECT. >>  WHICH IS WHY I INTRODUCED  THE OTHERS. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF HAVING A  GRADED RESPONSE, LIKE NEW YORK  AND BOSTON, OR ALTERNATIVE  SYSTEM OF PEOPLE SELF  MARSHALING THEMSELVES, WE HAVE  TO DO SOMETHING. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. AND THE THING WE'RE FOCUSED ON  IS THE 40 MILL MAOELTERS. >> WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU  ON ANYTHING ALONG THE LINE,  WHERE WE HAVE TO DEVELOP  RELATIONSHIPS WE'RE ALL IN ON  THAT. WHAT WE'RE LOOK TO GO DO IS  MAINTAIN THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED  TO KEEP OUR PEOPLE SAFE AND  PUBLIC SAFE. >> H. Soto-Martinez: THANK YOU. >> Council President: THANK  YOU, MR. SOTO-MARTINEZ FOR THIS  DISCUSSION. AND THANK YOU CHIEF FOR SHOWING  UP. I JUST WANT TO ADD THIS, I WANT  TO THANK MR. SOTO-MARTINEZ FOR  HAVING THE COURAGE FOR RAISING  THIS ISSUE AND STRUGGLE AROUND  IT, SECOND I WANT TO THANK YOU  FOR COMING. AND THEN I JUST WANT TO MAKE  THIS REQUEST, BECAUSE I, I WANT  I'M SUPPORTIVE OF OUR OFFICERS  OF WORK WE DO, BUT THIS IS NOT  AN AREA WHERE THERE ISN'T ROOM  FOR GREAT IMPROVEMENT. SO YOU ININVITED MEMBERS OF THE  COUNCIL TO BE WITH THE POLICE  ARE. I'VE BEEN WHERE TEAR GAS HAS  BEEN SHOT AT ME AND SOMEBODY  LOOKS ME AND I JUST DEESCALATE  IT, IT JUST DOESN'T WASH. IT DOESN'T MATCH WHAT IS  REALITY. AND THEN WHEN I CONFRONT THE  DEPARTMENT AND SAY, WELL YOU  ASKED ME TO DISBURSE, I WAS  WALKING AWAY AND TEAR GAS CAME  ON ME AND THE ANSWER WAS I  COULD HAVE USED A LETHAL FORCE. I JUST WANT TO REQUEST THAT AS  WE GO FORWARD, I'M SURE THIS  WILL COME UP AGAIN, THAT WE  WORK ON ONE, HOW TO COMMUNICATE  WITH EACH OTHER BUT TWO, HAVE  SOME ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND  HUMILITY THAT WE CAN DO BETTER  THAN WE HAVE DONE. >> WE ALWAYS CAN DO BETTER. AND I'M HAPPY WITH ANY MEMBER  OF THE COUNCIL TO WORK TO SHOW  WHAT TRAINING GOES INTO IT. THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. I APPRECIATE THAT. >> Council President: THANK YOU  SO MUCH, CHIEF. ALL RIGHT, MADAM CLERK, WE HAVE  AN AMENDMENT AND THEN AN ITEM. >> Clerk: YES, MR. PRESIDENT. SO THE FIRST VOTE WOULD BE ON  AMENDMENT 24-A AND THAT IS  MOTION SOTO-MARTINEZ-HERNANDEZ. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, LET'S OPEN THE ROLL,  CLOSE THE ROLL, TABULATE THE  VOTE. >> Clerk: 5 AYES, 7 NOES. >> Council President: ALL RIGHT. >> Clerk: THAT AMENDMENT FAILS. SO THE NEXT. >> Council President:  COUNCILMEMBER HERNANDEZ. >> E. Hernandez: I WOULD LIKE  MY  >> Clerk: THAT WOULD MAKE THE  FINAL VOTE 6 YESES AND-- >> Council President: IT NEEDS  LIKE WE NEED TO REVOTE. COUNCILMEMBER HUTT. >> H. Hutt: I WOULD LIKE TO BE  RECORDED AS A NO. >> Council President: LET'S  OPEN THE RECONSIDERATION ON  THIS ITEM. CLOSE THE ROLL, TABULATE THE  VOTE. >> Clerk: 6 AYES, 6 NO? >> >> Council President: TO  RECONSIDER. >> Clerk: OKAY. LET'S, COULD COUNCIL JUST CLEAR  THE VOTES AND JUST WRITE  NOW,  TO RECONSIDER THE VOTE FOR 24 A. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, SO 24 A IN YOU'RE IN  FAVOR OF MR. SOTO-MARTINEZ--IN  FAVOR OF RECONSIDERING SO BE--. >> Y. Jurado: JUST RECORD THE  NO-RECORD. >> Clerk: THANK YOU,  COUNCILMEMBER. SO FOR THE RECORD, ITEM 24, THE  FINAL VOTE IS 9 AYES AND 3 NOES. OKAY. NOW, THE NEXT FEW ITEMS THAT IS  BEFORE US COUNCIL IS  29 AND 41. >> Council President: THANK  YOU, CHIEF. AND MR. CITY ATTORNEY. ALL RIGHT, MADAM CLERK, SORRY. >> Clerk: NEXT WOULD BE ITEMS  29 AND 43 AND THAT WAS CALLED  SPECIAL BY COUNCILMEMBER JURADO  FOR A SEPARATE VOTE. >> Council President: ALL RIGHT. LET'S OPEN THE ROLL,  COUNCILMEMBER JURADO, CLOSE THE  ROLL, TABULATE THE VOTE. >> Clerk: 10 AYES, 2 NOES. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, WHAT'S NEXT? >> Clerk: NEXT WOULD BE ITEM 38  AND IS A SUBSTITUTE MOTION THAT  REQUIRES TWO VOTE. THE FIRST QUESTION  WHETHER TO SUBSTITUTE. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, LET'S OPEN THE ROLL ON  SUBSTITUTION, CLOSE THE ROLL,  TABULATE THE VOTE. >> Clerk: 12 AYES. >> Council President: ALL RIGHT. >> Clerk: THE NEXT VOTE WOULD  BE ON THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION,  YAROSLAVSKY-HERNANDEZ. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, LET'S OPEN THE ROLL,  CLOSE THE ROLL, TABULATE THE  VOTE. >> Clerk: 12 AYES. >> Clerk: AND FINALLY, THE LAST  ITEM BEFORE COUNCIL FOR TODAY  IS ITEM 45. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT, LET'S OPEN THE ROLL ON  45, CALLED SPECIAL BY RAMAN FOR  QUESTIONS, IT DOES NOT LOOK  LIKE SHE HAS QUESTIONS, CLOSE  THE ROLL, TABULATE THE VOTE. >> Clerk: 12 AYES. >> Council President: ALL  RIGHT,. >> Clerk: COUNCIL HAS MOTIONED  FOR POSTED AND REFERRAL. >> Council President: BUDGET  COMMITTEE WILL BE HELD AT 2:30,  IT'S BEEN MOVED BACK. MR. LEE? >> J. Lee: FORTHWITH. >> Council President: 24  FORTHWITH. WITHOUT OBJECTION. >> T. McOsker: AND 45 FORTHWITH. >> Council President:  24 AND  45. >> THE ECONOMICS AND JOBS MEETI. >> Council President: OKAY. ANY OTHER ANNOUNCEMENT? OKAY, WE ASK EVERYBODY TO RISE  FOR ADJOURNING MOTIONS. LOOKS LIKE THE SUN IS GOING  DOWN ALREADY. ADJOURNING MOTION TO SEE MY  LEFT? ADJOURNING MOTIONS TO MY RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ADJOURNED. SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. If you are outside, move to a clear area and stay away from anything that could fall on you like buildings, power lines or trees. If you are at the beach, immediately move to higher ground and follow tsunami evacuation signs. If you are driving, pull over to a clear location and stop. Avoid bridges, overpasses, and power lines. If you are in a wheelchair, lock your wheels. Bend over and cover your head. For more information, visit the Earthquake Country Alliance's website. Now onto wildfire tips. If you do not receive warning in advance of a wildfire, only collect your grab and go kit. If it's safe to do so. Follow evacuation orders and help others. If moving through a smoke filled area. Stay low to the ground. If you do receive a prepare to evacuate warning, gather your loved ones and pets. Ready your go bags. Charge your cell phones and plan your evacuation route. Lastly, let's talk about an active shooter situation. An active shooter is someone who is trying to kill and injure people. If you find yourself in such a situation, it's important to keep in mind the run, hide, fight survival principles. Your first option is to drop everything and run. If possible, try to help others escape, but do not attempt to move the wounded. Once you're safe, call 911. If you cannot escape, find the nearest hiding place. Lock the door or block the entry to your hiding place with tables, chairs, or whatever you can find. Make sure to silence your cell phone. If you are out of all other options, then fight. Try to incapacitate the shooter in whatever way possible. And remember, commit to your actions, your life depends on it. Once law enforcement arrives, remain calm. Follow their instructions and keep your hands free and visible at all times. Learn more about active shooter protocols at Run, hide, fight LA Org. It's not over just yet. The aftermath of an emergency is still a crucial time for you to remain alert and aware. Stay clear of hazards like downed power lines, damaged buildings, and avoid using gas until your gas line has been inspected. Cooperate fully with public safety officials and listen to local radio and TV stations for updated information. Avoid driving during this time and only use your vehicle if there is an evacuation order. Recovery time for different emergencies varies, but conditions commonly remain unstable. Two hours to two days after the emergency. If you have evacuated your home, don't reenter until officials say it's safe. If you're sheltering in place, it's important to assess and secure the area. Checking for gas and water leaks or broken wiring. If there is utility damage, turn them off at the source and check with your utility company before switching them on again. Do not shut off your gas valve unless you smell or hear gas leaking. A gas leak might smell like rotten eggs. To switch off your gas, you will most likely need to take a half turn on the main valve with a wrench. Report any gas leaks to your utility company. If a gas leak is suspected, do not operate any electrical switches. If water pipes are damaged, turn off the main water valve. Be sure not to flush the toilet until you know if the sewage lines are intact. If you have to shelter in place for a long time, assess your water sources.

After adding bleach, stir the container and let it stand for 30 minutes before drinking. You now have some basic knowledge to safely respond during and after an emergency . Perfect. Hi, I'm Christina Rice, I am the senior librarian. Of the Los Angeles Public Library's photo collection. Our collection has over 3 million photos documenting life in Los Angeles from the 1850s to the present, which means there are a lot of photographers represented in our collection who produced these images. So today, I wanted to focus on one of them, and that's Carol Westwood. So Carol Westwood was a local photographer. She primarily did a lot of film work, so she would be on the sets of movies, but she also, you know, was a street photographer and loved the city she lived in. And captured it, you know, from downtown to the ocean. All of the photos she donated are digitized so you can go to Tesa Lapl.org to view the archive. And her photos kind of like run the gamut in terms of subject matter and style. So sometimes, you know, she would take very kind of gorgeous scenic photos of Los Angeles, be it the, the skyline or the ocean . She would sometimes go to the airport and shoot the planes taking off and landing. But she'd also, you know, just get into her car and just shoot the city from her car. And so here's one example of that. So it's Main Street. It's the skid row area, um, where you can actually see her car, and you can also see the side mirror. So that's how you can kind of identify and get a sense of where she was. So there are a lot of interesting photos like that. Um, you know, she would also sometimes go into buildings and this is, I think, a really fascinating photo. It's the Taft building in Hollywood where she had the vantage point to look into the building. And so we can kind of see people working. So it's very rear window this photo, you know, and then there are other iconic photos of the Hollywood sign. Here's just a really interesting rear view of the Broadway Hollywood sign. And I mentioned she shot on a number of different mediums. So we also have color photos. And so we have some slides and sometimes she'll just do just kind of whimsical things. So we have the Smith Brothers fish Chanty restaurant on La Cienega, the entrance of which is just a giant whale mouth. So this is something that no longer exists. Sadly, I never got to visit, but it's wonderful that we have this color, you know, visual documentation of it. Um she shot on Melrose a lot. One of the images that really resonates with me is this image of aardvarks. Odd arc. Um secondhand clothing store, vintage clothing store on Melrose. And this was a shop I would go to quite a bit in the late 80s and early 90s. My mom, when I was in high school, she would take me there, um, to do back to school shopping and so this is an image that, you know, just brings back a lot of memories. So I think carols is a collection that, you know, if you want to see the city kind of as it was in the 80s and 90s, it's there. Um, if you lived through it, I think you can go and it can generate a great deal of nostalgia. And I think it's just also interesting to kind of see a photographer's perspective . So, you know, we have all of these photos in our collection. And I think a lot of times people will search for specific things, which is great, but sometimes it's also, I think, nice to look like at a photographer's body of work to kind of get a sense of what resonated with them and how they were viewing the city. And I think it also, um, points out how important it is when you know, photos are posted online that the photographers need to be credited because, you know, it was their vision. They produced this. And in Carol's case, you know, she very consciously wanted to make sure that the world had access to her photos. So you know, the least we can do is honor her by crediting her. So again, if you want to visit Carol's archive, you can go to Tesa Lapl.org, where there's also over 135,000 photos in counting from our entire photo collection.
