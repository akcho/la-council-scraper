  "summary": "# Summary: Council File 24-0777 - Marketing Specialist Classification Restoration\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Personnel and Hiring Committee recommends that the Los Angeles City Council adopt an ordinance to restore the \"Marketing Specialist\" job classification (Class Code 1807) to the City's official list of civilian positions in the Los Angeles Administrative Code. This is a non-represented (non-union) position that the City accidentally removed from its records.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe Marketing Specialist classification was originally established by the City Council on August 12, 2008, through Ordinance No. 180119, with an effective date of January 1, 2007. However, when the City updated its official classification list in subsequent ordinances, this position was inadvertently omitted. Most recently, the position was missing from Ordinance No. 188307, adopted in July 2024. This ordinance corrects that administrative error by formally restoring the classification.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Class Code:** 1807\n- **Type:** Non-represented (non-union) position\n- **Originally Established:** August 12, 2008\n- **Fiscal Impact:** None — hiring costs will be absorbed within existing 2025-26 budget funds\n- **Committee Vote:** 2 YES votes (McOsker, Rodriguez), 1 Absent (Soto-Martinez)\n- **Date Approved:** October 24, 2025\n\n## Impact\n\nThis restoration allows the City to officially hire or employ people in the Marketing Specialist role without legal ambiguity. Since there is no fiscal impact and costs fit within existing budgets, this primarily affects administrative clarity and the ability of city departments to staff this position appropriately.",
