  "summary": "# Summary: First Amendment to Permit No. 897 - Catalina Channel Express, Inc.\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThis First Amendment modifies the permit for Catalina Channel Express, Inc., a ferry operator at Berth 95 in San Pedro. The amendment updates the premises description to reflect physical changes made to the facility and adjusts compensation terms for the period from July 25, 2014 through July 24, 2019. The amended permit expands the premises to include seven parcels totaling approximately 187,000 square feet of combined land and water area.\n\n## Why This Change is Needed\n\nIn 2011, the China Shipping container terminal expansion forced Catalina Channel Express to relocate south from its original location. The tenant invested over $5 million in adaptive reuse of an existing Harbor Department building and facility improvements. During construction, the Harbor Department and tenant determined that modifications were necessary for safe and efficient access to additional water space. These changes required expanding the premises to include concrete ramps and installing four floating docks, which necessitated removing existing wooden wharf improvements. This amendment formally recognizes these physical changes and settles compensation disputes.\n\n## Key Financial and Operational Details\n\nThe amendment establishes a tiered monthly compensation schedule: $5,027 (2012-2013), increasing to $10,707 (2016-2019). Starting July 25, 2023, the tenant will pay 5% of gross receipts exceeding the fixed minimum compensation. The amended premises includes a 7,544 sq. ft. warehouse building, 38,448 sq. ft. of unimproved land, 59,719 sq. ft. of water area with two concrete ramps, and additional berth and water areas. The amendment also settles three claims filed in December 2012 regarding overpaid rent and interest.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis amendment affects the ferry operator's business operations at the Port of Los Angeles and clarifies the company's occupancy rights and financial obligations. The settlement resolves pending disputes with the City, providing certainty for the operator's continued service to Catalina Island passengers while ensuring fair compensation to the Harbor Department for use of public waterfront facilities.",
