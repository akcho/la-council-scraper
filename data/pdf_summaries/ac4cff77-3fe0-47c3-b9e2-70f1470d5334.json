  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 24-1200-S11\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Arts, Parks, Libraries, and Community Enrichment Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council approve and confirm the Mayor's reappointment of Andrea Garcia to the Los Angeles City/County Native American Indian Commission. This reappointment would extend her service on the commission through October 7, 2029.\n\n## Key Details\nThe Committee considered this matter on October 28, 2025, and voted to approve the recommendation with support from Committee members Jurado and Hernandez (Nazarian was absent). The current board composition consists of 2 male and 3 female members. No financial disclosure statement or community impact statement was required for this appointment.\n\n## What This Means\nThis is a routine reappointment of an existing commission member to continue her work representing Native American Indian interests in Los Angeles. The Commission serves as an advisory body for City and County government on matters affecting Native American communities. The appointment now requires full City Council approval to become official, at which point it will be considered final.",
