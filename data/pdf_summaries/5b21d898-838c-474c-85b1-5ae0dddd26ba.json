  "summary": "# Summary: Third Amendment to Permit No. 708 - Kinder Morgan Tank Storage Terminals\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City of Los Angeles is approving a Third Amendment to Permit No. 708, which extends the operating term for Kinder Morgan Tank Storage Terminals LLC at Berths 118-119 in the Harbor District. The amendment extends the permit through April 13, 2025, and establishes new requirements for facility improvements, operations cessation, demolition, and environmental remediation.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe original permit was granted in 1988 and previously extended in 2013 and 2018. Kinder Morgan has not yet found a suitable alternative location to relocate its operations. Rather than force immediate closure, the City agreed to extend the permit to allow time for the company to complete California State Lands Commission (CSLC) audits on the wharf's structural condition and potentially conduct repairs needed to continue operations. The extension also allows the company to complete its ongoing soil and groundwater contamination cleanup obligations begun in previous amendments.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Operations Cessation Date:** April 13, 2024 (with possible extension via Executive Director approval)\n- **Surrender Date:** April 13, 2025\n- **Divided Property:** Part of the site was already surrendered in December 2015 after demolition and interim remediation\n- **Remaining Facilities:** Office, Vapor Recovery Unit, and specific tank operations at Berths 118-119\n- **Critical Requirement:** Tenant must obtain CSLC approval to continue wharf operations, including completion of Marine Oil Terminal Engineering and Maintenance Standards (MOTEMS) audits and any required wharf repairs at Kinder Morgan's expense\n\n## Impact\n\nThis amendment affects Port of Los Angeles operations and the surrounding community. If Kinder Morgan fails to meet CSLC requirements or deadline milestones, operations will cease automatically. The extended timeline requires the company to complete environmental remediation and wharf structural repairs, with enforcement mechanisms ensuring compliance. Residents should monitor whether the facility meets structural and environmental standards to continue operating.",
