  "summary": "# Summary: 2024-2029 Salary Schedule for Non-Represented City Employees\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThis document presents a revised salary schedule for Los Angeles City non-represented employees (those not covered by union contracts) covering the period from June 30, 2024, through July 1, 2028. The schedule outlines salary ranges and amounts for approximately 300+ job classifications, with scheduled increases occurring on specific dates throughout this period.\n\n## Why?\n\nNon-represented employees require periodic salary adjustments to remain competitive with market rates, ensure fiscal sustainability, and maintain employee retention. This revised schedule supersedes the previous version and reflects updated compensation levels across eight distinct pay periods over the four-year span.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe salary schedule includes eight adjustment dates: June 30, 2024; December 29, 2024; June 29, 2025; December 28, 2025; June 28, 2026; December 27, 2026; June 27, 2027; and December 26, 2027/July 1, 2028. Salaries are presented as either monthly amounts or hourly rates, depending on position type. For example, an Academy Trainee (Code 2208) increases from $23.22/hour on June 30, 2024, to $27.71/hour by July 1, 2028. Higher-level positions like the Executive Director of Public Accountability increase from $11,392 to $13,606 monthly over the same period.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects all approximately 300+ non-represented City employees across various departments, including administrative, technical, managerial, and professional roles. The scheduled increases provide predictable salary growth over the four-year period, potentially improving employee morale and retention while requiring corresponding budgetary allocations for the City's personnel costs.",
