  "summary": "# Summary: LAwell Program Employee Benefits Trust Fund Review\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Personnel and Hiring Committee is recommending that the City Council **note and file** (formally acknowledge and record) the August 7, 2025 review of the LAwell Program Employee Benefits Trust Fund for fiscal year 2024-25. This is a routine administrative action to document the fund's status rather than a new policy or funding decision.\n\n## Why?\nThe LAwell Program Employee Benefits Trust Fund operates as the central account managing health insurance and benefits contributions for city employees. Annual reviews ensure the fund is operating properly and efficiently in serving approximately 27,000 city employees and 33,000 dependents. The fund was formally established in 1997 under Los Angeles Administrative Code to receive and distribute employer and employee contributions to benefit service providers.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Coverage:** ~27,000 employees and 33,000 dependents\n- **Governance:** Managed by the Joint Labor-Management Benefits Committee (JLMBC), established in 1990, comprising five management and five labor representatives\n- **Fund Purpose:** Serves as a pass-through account for premium payments to benefit providers, funded by General Fund transfers, proprietary transfers, employee contributions, and interest earnings\n- **Committee Vote:** Passed 2-0 (McOsker and Rodriguez voted YES; Soto-Martinez was absent) on October 24, 2025\n\n## Impact\nThis action has no fiscal impact on the city budget and is primarily an informational filing. It maintains transparency about how the city manages employee benefits funding and ensures the JLMBC's administration of the program continues to align with the stated mission of providing competitive benefits at reasonable cost.",
