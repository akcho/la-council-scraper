  "summary": "# Summary: Communication from Public - Council File 25-1146\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nMartin Byhower, a long-time advocate for Ken Malloy Harbor Regional Park, is submitting a public comment in support of an unspecified measure (referenced as \"this measure\") related to the park. While the exact proposal is not detailed in this communication, Byhower indicates it involves protective measures to control public access to sensitive habitat areas.\n\n## Why?\nByhower emphasizes that Ken Malloy Harbor Regional Park has successfully recovered thanks to prior restoration efforts and protective measures. He argues that the park's natural values can only be sustained if strong measures are implemented to prevent unauthorized wandering and trespassing into valuable habitat areas. His support is grounded in decades of personal stewardship and his instrumental role in securing approximately $100 in Proposition O funding that enabled the park's initial restoration.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Submitter:** Martin Byhower (now residing in Texas)\n- **Location:** Ken Malloy Harbor Regional Park in Harbor City/Wilmington\n- **Background:** Byhower spent over 30 years advocating for the park, including service on the Park Advisory Board\n- **Prior Funding:** Proposition O funding (approximately $100) was secured for restoration and improvements\n- **Submission Date:** October 10, 2025\n\n## Impact\nThis communication represents public support from a credible, long-term park advocate for measures designed to protect the park's ecological resources. The measure would likely affect visitors by restricting access to certain habitat areas, though the specific restrictions are not detailed in this document.",
