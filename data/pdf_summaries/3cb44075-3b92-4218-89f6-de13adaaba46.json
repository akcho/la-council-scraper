  "summary": "# Community Impact Statement Summary - Council File 25-1223\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Central Hollywood Neighborhood Council (CHNC) is submitting a Community Impact Statement in **support** of Council File 25-1223, which directs City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto to withdraw her unilateral motion to lift a September 2025 injunction against the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) regarding use of force against journalists.\n\n## Why This Matters?\n\nThe CHNC opposes the City Attorney's attempt to lift the injunction because it was filed without consulting the City Council, the city's elected legislative body, and without public notice or input. A federal judge determined that LAPD engaged in \"unlawful force against members of the media.\" Since June 2025, at least 60 new liability claims have reportedly been filed against LAPD by journalists and protesters alleging further use of force. The CHNC argues that proper procedures and accountability are essential to maintaining public trust.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Vote:** Unanimous (7-0-0) in favor of the position\n- **Date Approved:** October 27, 2025\n- **Judge:** Hernán Vera of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued the original injunction\n- **Liability Claims:** At least 60 new claims filed since June 2025\n\n## Impact\n\nThe CHNC emphasizes that accountability, transparency, and lawful process are fundamental to democratic governance and maintaining public trust in Los Angeles government. The council calls on city leadership to follow established protocols and reaffirm adherence to oversight mechanisms.",
