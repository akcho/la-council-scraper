  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 25-1197\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Personnel and Hiring Committee recommends that the Los Angeles City Council **approve exempting one Deputy City Engineer position from Civil Service requirements**. This exemption would allow the Bureau of Engineering to hire for this role without going through the standard civil service process.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe position is needed to lead the **$2.6 billion Los Angeles Convention Center (LACC) Expansion and Modernization Project**. This is a major, fast-moving project requiring specialized project management. The Deputy City Engineer will serve as Project Executive, overseeing up to 38 combined staff members (Bureau of Engineering employees and consultants) and managing all reporting to City Hall, the City Council, Board of Public Works, and the Municipal Facilities Oversight Committee. The project has tight timelines—the first Notice to Proceed to the design/build contractor was scheduled for September 30, 2025.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- The position would be the **122nd of 150 allowed exemptions** under City Charter Section 1001(b)\n- The Bureau aimed to fill the position by **mid-October 2025**\n- The Committee voted on **October 24, 2025** (with 2 Yes votes, 1 Absent)\n- **Deadline for Council action: November 5, 2025**\n- No fiscal impact statement was submitted with the report\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects the governance structure of a major city infrastructure project, allowing the Bureau of Engineering to hire a specialized executive manager outside traditional civil service hiring processes to better manage this complex, time-sensitive project.",
