  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 25-0002-S86\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to support S.2468 (Padilla), a federal bill that would modernize U.S. immigration law by removing outdated eligibility restrictions and allowing millions of long-term residents to apply for permanent residency status. The city would formally add this support to its 2025-26 State Legislative Program.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe current immigration system relies on outdated provisions from the 1929 Immigration Act. Under existing law, the Registry statute gives the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to grant permanent residency to only certain immigrants. S.2468 would expand this eligibility to include immigrants without criminal records who have lived continuously in the United States for at least seven years, addressing a gap that has left many long-term residents in immigration limbo.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe Rules, Elections and Intergovernmental Relations Committee reviewed the proposal on October 21, 2025, and voted unanimously to recommend approval (5-0 vote: Harris-Dawson, Raman, Yaroslavsky, Soto-Martinez, and Lee all voted yes). Two neighborhood councils—Eagle Rock and Los Feliz—have publicly supported the measure. There is no identified fiscal impact to the city.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis support would affect millions of long-term U.S. residents seeking legal status and permanent residency. The measure carries community backing from local neighborhood councils and aligns with the city's advocacy at the state legislative level for immigration reform benefiting established residents.",
