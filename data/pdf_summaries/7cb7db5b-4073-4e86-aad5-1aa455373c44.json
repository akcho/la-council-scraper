  "summary": "# Summary: Motion for Reward in Connection with June 2, 2024 Shooting Deaths\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Council is being asked to offer a $75,000 reward for information leading to the identification, apprehension, and conviction of the person or persons responsible for a fatal shooting on June 2, 2024. The motion directs the City Clerk to publish notices and advertisements about this reward offer according to city procedures.\n\n## Why?\nOn June 2, 2024, at approximately 12:15 a.m., LAPD officers responded to a shooting at 15th Street and Maple Avenue where a vehicle had been struck by bullets. Two victims were found—Clarence Simpson and Christian Hart—both suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. Despite a full investigation, detectives have been unable to identify the suspects. The motion argues that the responsible person or persons represent an ongoing threat to public safety and that a reward may encourage witnesses to come forward with crucial information.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Incident:** Fatal shooting on June 2, 2024, at 15th Street and Maple Avenue\n- **Victims:** Clarence Simpson and Christian Hart (both killed)\n- **Reward Amount:** $75,000 maximum\n- **Duration:** Six months from the date the reward is advertised\n- **Presented by:** Councilmember Ysabel Jurado (14th District)\n- **Document filed:** October 31, 2025\n\n## Impact\nThis motion affects all Los Angeles residents and visitors by addressing ongoing public safety concerns.
