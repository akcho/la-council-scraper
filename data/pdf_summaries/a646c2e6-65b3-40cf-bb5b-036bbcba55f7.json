  "summary": "# Summary: Appointment of Vivian Garcia to Native American Indian Commission\n\n## What is Being Proposed\nMayor Karen Bass is appointing Ms. Vivian Garcia to the Los Angeles City-County Native American Indian Commission for a term ending October 7, 2025. The appointment is subject to City Council confirmation and will fill the vacancy left by Joseph Quintana's departure.\n\n## Why This Appointment\nThe Mayor certifies that Garcia is \"especially qualified by reason of training and experience\" for the position. Garcia brings relevant credentials including a Master's degree in Early Childhood Education and a Bachelor's degree in American Indian Studies from UCLA. She currently serves as Tribal & Community Liaison for United American Indian Involvement (UAII), where she develops partnerships with tribal governments and community organizations serving the Native American population in Los Angeles County. She is also an active council member for Tsa-La-Gi LA (Cherokees of Los Angeles), an official Cherokee Nation affiliate, and is a proud Cherokee citizen with deep community roots.\n\n## Key Details\nGarcia has direct experience advocating for the underserved Urban Indian population through roles including In-Home Outreach Counselor at the Southern California Indian Center (2018-2019), Care Coordinator at UAII (2019-2020), and her current position since October 2020. Before Council confirmation, she must complete several requirements within one week: submit a Remuneration Form and two undated Separation Letters, schedule a fingerprinting appointment for a background check, and potentially meet with her City Councilmember and Committee Chair.\n\n## Impact\nThis appointment strengthens the Commission's representation of the Native American community with a professional who has direct experience serving vulnerable populations and building tribal relationships. The appointment requires City Council confirmation and will be reviewed by the Neighborhoods and Community Enrichment Committee before a full Council vote.",
