  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 24-1200-S19\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Arts, Parks, Libraries, and Community Enrichment Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council approve and confirm the Mayor's reappointment of Vivian Garcia to the Los Angeles City/County Native American Indian Commission for a new term ending October 7, 2029.\n\n## Background and Details\n\nThis is a routine reappointment matter that was considered by the committee on October 28, 2025. After allowing for public comment, the committee voted to approve the recommendation, with two members voting yes (Jurado and Hernandez) and one member absent (Nazarian). The current board composition will include 2 male and 3 female members, achieving gender balance on the commission.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis reappointment ensures continued representation on a commission that serves the Native American Indian community in Los Angeles. The matter is now forwarded to the full City Council for final approval. The document notes it is \"not official until Council acts,\" meaning the reappointment becomes final only after the full Council votes on it.",
