  "summary": "# Summary: Kinder Morgan Oil Terminal Permit Extension\n\n## What is Being Proposed\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to approve a five-year extension to Permit No. 708 for Kinder Morgan Storage Terminals, LLC. This extension would allow the company to continue operating its marine oil terminal at Berths 118 and 119 in the Port of Los Angeles until October 13, 2023. The council is also being asked to adopt a categorical exemption under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), meaning the project is not subject to full environmental review.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe extension provides Kinder Morgan with a transition period to relocate to a new facility. The permit extension is contingent on Kinder Morgan receiving California State Lands Commission approval to clean up and restore the marine terminal site by April 2018. This addresses the company's operational needs while ensuring environmental remediation of the current site.\n\n## Key Details and Financial Impact\n\nThe agreement includes approximately $2.4 million in annual compensation to the Port in 2016, covering land rent, wharfage, and dockage fees. This compensation will be adjusted every five years and includes an annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustment to account for inflation. All other terms from the original permit and its first amendment remain unchanged.\n\n## Committee Recommendation\n\nOn August 15, 2017, the Trade, Travel, and Tourism Committee recommended council approval, with committee members Buscaino and Krekorian voting yes, and Bonin absent. The Board of Harbor Commissioners and the City Administrative Officer both support this action. The council deadline for action was August 25, 2017.",
