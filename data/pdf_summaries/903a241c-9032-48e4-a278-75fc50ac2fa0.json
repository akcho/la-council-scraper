  "summary": "# Summary: Communication from Public Regarding Council File 25-1295\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nCarrie McCrossen is writing in support of a resolution (Council File #25-1295) introduced by Councilmembers Hernandez and Jurado and seconded by Councilmember Soto-Martinez on October 31, 2025. The resolution **opposes a proposed gondola system from Union Station to Dodger Stadium** and urges the Metro Board to deny approval of the project's Environmental Impact Report (EIR).\n\n## Why?\nThe writer argues that the gondola is not the best solution for improving stadium access and would harm the community. She emphasizes that the parks in the area—Elysian Park and LA Historic Park—are public goods used daily by families and schools and should not be disrupted. She points out that shuttle buses are already a successful transportation alternative. Most significantly, she stresses that the three councilmembers opposing the project represent the directly impacted communities (Council Districts 1, 13, and 14) and their constituents are opposed to the gondola.\n\n## Key Details\n- The resolution identifies specific areas of concern: neighborhoods in historic Los Angeles including Olvera Street, Chinatown, Solano Canyon, El Pueblo de Los Ángeles Historic Monument, Los Angeles State Historic Park, and Elysian Park\n- Shuttle buses have proven effective, with the writer's senior parents having recently used them successfully\n- The resolution calls for fair and objective study of alternative transportation solutions\n\n## Impact\nThis affects residents of Central Los Angeles, particularly families using the parks for recreation and education, as well as anyone relying on transportation to Dodger Stadium. The decision impacts the preservation of historic neighborhoods and public green spaces.",
