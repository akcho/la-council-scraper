  "summary": "# Summary: LA City Council Support for SB 84 (Niello)\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles City Council's Rules, Elections and Intergovernmental Relations Committee is recommending that the City support Senate Bill 84 (SB 84) at the state level. The bill would give businesses an opportunity to fix construction-related accessibility problems before facing penalties, clarify notice requirements for disability access complaints, and prevent fraudulent accessibility-related lawsuits.\n\n## Why?\nThe proposal responds to a serious problem identified in San Francisco and Northern California. In 2021, there was a dramatic spike in ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) lawsuits filed against small, immigrant-owned businesses. According to the San Francisco District Attorney, many of these lawsuits were fraudulent and deliberately targeted vulnerable business owners—particularly those with limited English proficiency and little access to legal representation. These owners were pressured into cash settlements, causing many businesses to close.\n\n## Key Details\nThe Committee voted unanimously (5-0) on October 21, 2025, to recommend approval. The resolution was originally introduced on August 12, 2025. The Committee is asking the City to include SB 84 support in its 2025-26 State Legislative Program. The bill specifically aims to protect small business owners from predatory litigation while still maintaining disability access protections through a more fair process.\n\n## Impact\nThis affects small business owners—particularly immigrants and vulnerable populations—by providing legal protections against frivolous lawsuits while maintaining genuine accessibility standards for people with disabilities. The measure balances disability rights with fair treatment for businesses facing potentially fraudulent claims.",
