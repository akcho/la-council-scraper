  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 25-1070: Oath and Affirmation Documents\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThis document is an administrative filing containing standard oath and affirmation forms for Patrice Y. Lattimore, who is being enrolled as a City of Los Angeles public employee in the Disaster Service Worker Program. The document includes three required legal acknowledgments: a Code of Ethics certification, a Federal Privacy Act notice regarding Social Security Number usage, and an Oath of Loyalty required under California Government Code.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThese documents are mandatory legal requirements for all City of Los Angeles employees. They establish that the employee understands their ethical obligations, privacy protections, and constitutional duties. The Oath of Loyalty specifically requires employees to support and defend the U.S. and California constitutions and faithfully discharge their duties. The Federal Privacy Act notice informs employees about how their Social Security numbers will be used in payroll and personnel systems.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe forms were completed and signed on **September 16, 2025**. The oath was witnessed and administered by Deputy City Clerks Melinda Novoa and Andrew Suh. These oaths remain effective for the entire period the employee remains with the City of Los Angeles. The documents are part of standard onboarding procedures under Government Code §3100-3109.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects the individual employee by establishing their legal obligations to the City and clarifying their privacy rights. For the City, it ensures compliance with state and federal employment laws and confirms the employee's commitment to constitutional duties and ethical conduct.",
