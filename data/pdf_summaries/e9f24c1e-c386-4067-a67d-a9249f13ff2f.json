  "summary": "# Summary: Motion to Streamline Event Permitting for Small Businesses\n\n## What is Being Proposed\nThe motion asks the Bureau of Street Services, with assistance from the Bureau of Engineering and Department of Transportation, to develop recommendations for streamlining the permitting process for work conducted in Los Angeles public rights-of-way (streets, sidewalks, etc.) related to major events hosted in the city.\n\n## Why This Matters\nLos Angeles will host several major international events in coming years, including the FIFA World Cup, Super Bowl, NBA All-Star Game, and 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. These events create significant economic opportunities for small, local, and underrepresented businesses. However, businesses currently face delays and complicated permitting processes when they need to work in public spaces to support these events. The motion addresses two key concerns: (1) small businesses need better preparation and pre-certification systems to compete for event-related contracts, and (2) the City's permitting processes must be streamlined to avoid unnecessary delays and ensure the City is ready to host these events efficiently.\n\n## Key Details\nThe motion specifically focuses on permits currently required by City departments for work in the public right-of-way. It was presented by Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez (7th District) and seconded by another council member, dated September 10, 2025.\n\n## Impact\nThis primarily affects small and local businesses seeking to participate in economic activity surrounding major sporting and entertainment events. By streamlining permitting and establishing pre-certification processes, the motion aims to level the playing field and ensure these businesses can successfully bid on opportunities and contribute to the City's event infrastructure.",
