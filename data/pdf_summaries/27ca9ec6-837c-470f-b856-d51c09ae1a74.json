  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 25-0783\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Arts, Parks, Libraries, and Community Enrichment Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council approve proposed modifications to the Los Angeles Zoo Vision Plan. The committee also recommends determining that these modifications do not require a new or supplemental Environmental Impact Report (EIR), as they do not create new or substantially increased environmental impacts.\n\n## Why?\nThese project modifications are connected to a settlement agreement in a lawsuit case (Griffith J. Griffith Charitable Trust, et al. v. City of Los Angeles). The modifications represent changes to the original Zoo Vision Plan that was previously approved and environmentally reviewed by the City Council on August 2, 2023. Since the environmental impacts of these changes are not substantially different from what was already studied and approved, the committee determined that no additional environmental review is necessary under California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) regulations.\n\n## Key Details\nThe committee met on October 28, 2025, to consider a Zoo Department report dated October 21, 2025. The committee voted 2-1 to approve the recommendations (with one member absent). Importantly, the Zoo Department reports there is **no fiscal impact** or funding obligation associated with this approval, meaning taxpayers will not bear new costs.\n\n## Impact\nThese modifications affect the future development and operations of the Los Angeles Zoo. The approval allows the Zoo to proceed with plan changes while respecting the terms of the settlement agreement without triggering additional lengthy environmental review processes.",
