  "summary": "# Summary: Preventing Auto Recycling Theft Act Support\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to support two federal bills—S. 2238 (sponsored by Senator Klobuchar) and H.R. 5221 (sponsored by Representative Baird)—by including them in the City's 2025-26 Federal Legislative Program. These bills would require Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) to be etched onto catalytic converters to help identify and trace stolen parts.\n\n## Why This Matters?\nCatalytic converter theft has become a widespread problem that disproportionately harms lower-income communities and small businesses. The financial burden of replacing stolen converters, combined with vehicle downtime, creates significant hardship for vulnerable populations. Currently, the absence of identifiable markings on catalytic converters makes it extremely difficult for law enforcement to trace stolen parts, prosecute offenders, and help victims recover their losses.\n\n## Key Details\nThe Rules, Elections and Intergovernmental Relations Committee unanimously voted to recommend approval on October 21, 2025, with all five committee members voting yes (Harris-Dawson, Raman, Yaroslavsky, Soto-Martinez, and Lee). The proposal was supported by the Westside Neighborhood Council. The measure requires Mayor approval and is subject to full City Council action.\n\n## Impact\nIf adopted, this position would align Los Angeles with federal efforts to combat auto parts theft and protect residents—especially those in lower-income areas and small business owners—from the growing problem of catalytic converter theft.",
