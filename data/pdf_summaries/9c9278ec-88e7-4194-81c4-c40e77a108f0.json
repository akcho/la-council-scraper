  "summary": "# Summary: File No. 23-0100 - POLA and LAWA Sustainability Coordination Report\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council receive and file a joint report from the Port of Los Angeles (POLA) and Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) dated August 4, 2025. The report addresses information sharing practices and interdepartmental coordination related to sustainability initiatives between these two major city departments.\n\n## Why?\nThe committee sought to assess how effectively POLA and LAWA are coordinating with each other and sharing information on sustainability efforts. This review is part of broader city oversight to ensure these key transportation infrastructure agencies are aligned on environmental and sustainability goals and working collaboratively rather than in silos.\n\n## Key Details\nThe Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee held a public hearing on October 14, 2025, where they received public comment on the joint report. All three committee members (Park, McOsker, and Rodriguez) voted unanimously in favor of receiving and filing the report. No fiscal impact is associated with this action, and no community impact statement was submitted.\n\n## Impact\nThis action has minimal immediate impact on residents since the committee determined no further council action is needed at this time. However, the report itself may inform future coordination efforts between the Port and Airports on sustainability initiatives, potentially affecting environmental outcomes at Los Angeles's two largest transportation hubs.",
