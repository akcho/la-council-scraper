  "summary": "# Summary of Community Impact Statement - Council File 25-0916\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Westside Neighborhood Council has submitted a Community Impact Statement (CIS) supporting Council File #25-0916. The board voted to support this file because it would prevent smoke shops from being established or expanded near sensitive uses in the area.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe Westside Neighborhood Council identified smoke shops operating or expanding near sensitive locations as a community concern. By supporting this council file, the neighborhood council is advocating for regulatory measures to restrict or control the placement of such businesses in proximity to schools, parks, residential areas, and other sensitive community spaces.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Vote:** 13 Yes, 0 No, 0 Abstain, 0 Ineligible, 0 Recusal (unanimous approval)\n- **Board Action Date:** September 11, 2025\n- **Neighborhood Council:** Westside\n- **Contact:** Joseph Roth (wncseat18@gmail.com)\n- **Impact Date:** September 12, 2025\n\n## Impact\n\nThis statement affects residents in the Westside neighborhood by documenting community opposition to smoke shop expansion. If the council file advances, it could result in new land-use regulations limiting where smoke shops can operate, potentially protecting youth and families in the area from exposure to these businesses.",
