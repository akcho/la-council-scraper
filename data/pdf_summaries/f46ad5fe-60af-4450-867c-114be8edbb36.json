  "summary": "# Summary: SNAP-ED and CalFresh Grant Funding\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles Department of Aging (LADOA) is seeking City Council approval to accept grant funds from California's Department of Aging to support nutrition education programs. Specifically, the city would receive funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-ED) and CalFresh expansion programs for three fiscal years (2022-23 through 2024-25). The council would authorize LADOA to execute agreements with the state and partner agencies that will deliver these nutrition services to residents.\n\n## Why This Matters?\n\nThese grant programs help low-income residents access nutrition education and expand awareness of CalFresh benefits (California's food assistance program). The funding comes from the state at no cost to the City's General Fund, making it an opportunity to expand health and nutrition services without impacting the city budget.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe city would receive **$268,917 annually** for general aging and CalFresh expansion services, plus **$239,614 per year** for SNAP-ED programming provided by Consulting Nutritional Services. The funding covers three fiscal years (October 2022 through September 2025), and LADOA would partner with various public, private, nonprofit, and governmental organizations to deliver services. The Council's Civil Rights, Equity, Immigration, Aging and Disability Committee unanimously approved this recommendation on March 3, 2023.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis funding will support nutrition education programs serving low-income Los Angeles residents, with no additional burden on the city's General Fund. The programs help connect eligible residents with food assistance benefits and improve access to nutritional information.",
