  "summary": "# Summary: Successor Permit for DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel, San Pedro\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles Harbor Department is seeking City Council approval to renew and expand the operating permit (Permit No. 942) for the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel at 2800 Via Cabrillo Marina in San Pedro. The new 50-year successor permit would replace the existing agreement between the Harbor Department and LA Sky Harbor, LLC.\n\n## Key Changes and Financial Impact\n\nThe renewal significantly increases the city's revenue from the hotel operation. The fixed minimum annual rent would jump by $145,031.67—from $284,556.33 to $429,588 per year. Additionally, the permit expands the hotel's footprint by 42,350 square feet (from 7.13 to 8.1 acres) and restructures how percentage rent is calculated, moving from revenue-based percentages to fixed percentages across different revenue streams (5% for rooms and food/beverage, 3% for retail, 20% for parking, and 10% for vessel sales). All revenues will be deposited in the Harbor Revenue Fund with no impact on the city's General Fund.\n\n## Committee Recommendation\n\nThe Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee unanimously voted to approve all three recommendations: concurring with the categorical exemption from environmental review, approving the Harbor Department resolution authorizing the successor permit, and authorizing the Executive Director to execute the final agreement. The document indicates this matter is now ready for full City Council consideration.",
