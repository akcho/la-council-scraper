  "summary": "# Summary: 2017-21 Port Pilots Memorandum of Understanding\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Personnel and Animal Welfare Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council approve a new four-year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the Port Pilots bargaining unit (MOU No. 26) covering the period 2017-2021. The committee also recommends authorizing the City Administrative Officer and Controller to correct any clerical or technical errors in the agreement.\n\n## Key Details\nThe MOU was considered at a committee meeting on September 6, 2017, following a City Administrative Officer report and public comment period. The committee voted unanimously to recommend approval, with two members voting yes (Price and Englander) and one absent (Koretz).\n\n## Financial Impact\nImplementation of the MOU will cost approximately **$450,000 per year for each of the four years** of the agreement. Notably, these costs will be paid by the Harbor Department rather than the city's General Fund, so there is no impact to the general city budget.\n\n## What Happens Next\nThis committee recommendation now goes to the full City Council for a final vote. The document is not considered official until the Council acts on it.",
