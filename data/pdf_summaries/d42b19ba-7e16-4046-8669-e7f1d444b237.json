  "summary": "# Summary: Request for Closed Session on Settlement Discussion\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Attorney's Office is requesting that the Claims Board hold a closed session meeting to discuss and receive legal advice regarding a settlement recommendation in the case **Daniela Arancibia v. City of Los Angeles** (LASC Case No. 24CHCV02664, Claim No. C24-09961).\n\n## Why?\nThis request is being made under California Government Code Section 54956.9(d)(1), which permits public agencies to conduct closed sessions when discussing pending litigation with legal counsel. The closed session format allows the board to receive confidential legal advice about settlement negotiations without the discussions being open to the public—a protection that is standard in litigation matters to preserve attorney-client privilege and protect negotiation strategy.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Incident:** A trip and fall incident that occurred on March 21, 2024, near 9901 Oso Avenue in Chatsworth, California\n- **Claimant:** Daniela Arancibia\n- **Contact:** Sireen Sawaf, Deputy City Attorney, (213) 978-6923\n- **Date of Report:** October 9, 2025\n- **Involved Department:** Board of Public Works Commission\n\n## Impact\nThis matter affects how the City handles a personal injury claim. The closed session will allow the Claims Board to consider settlement terms with full legal guidance before making a decision, protecting both the claimant's and the City's interests during negotiations.",
