  "summary": "# Summary: Contract Amendment for Airport Maintenance Supplies\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\nThe Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council approve a contract amendment with Vista Paint Corporation to continue supplying retroreflective glass beads (reflective materials used on airport runways and taxiways) for Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA). The amendment would increase the contract value by $1.86 million and extend the agreement for two additional years.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Contract:** First Amendment to Contract DA-5640 with Vista Paint Corporation\n- **Financial Impact:** Total contract value increases from $2.79 million to $4.65 million\n- **Duration:** Contract extends two years, from May 30, 2026 to May 29, 2028 (115 months total)\n- **Funding Source:** LAWA's Cost Center for Airside Maintenance & Repair; no impact on the city's General Fund\n- **Committee Vote:** Unanimous approval (Park, McOsker, and Rodriguez all voted YES on October 14, 2025)\n\n## Why This Matters\nRetroreflective glass beads are essential safety materials that help pilots see runway markings during low-visibility conditions. This amendment ensures LAWA can maintain continuous supply of this critical safety material without service interruption. The City Attorney has approved the contract language, and the Board of Airport Commissioners determined this action does not require environmental review under CEQA.",
