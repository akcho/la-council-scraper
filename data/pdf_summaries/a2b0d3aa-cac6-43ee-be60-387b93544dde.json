  "summary": "# Summary: Council File 12-0344 - Permit Amendment for Port Operations\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Trade, Travel, and Tourism Committee is recommending that Los Angeles City Council approve a Third Amendment to Permit No. 897 with Catalina Channel Express, Inc. at the Port of Los Angeles. The amendment would expand the company's leased premises by 32,881 square feet to accommodate freight operations through a sublease agreement with Avalon Freight Services, LLC.\n\n## Why This Matters?\n\nCatalina Channel Express is expanding its port operations to handle additional freight work through its sublease partner, Avalon Freight Services. This expansion requires a larger leased area and a corresponding increase in the rent paid to the Port. The amendment has been reviewed and approved by both the Board of Harbor Commissioners (June 1, 2017) and the City Administrative Officer, confirming it aligns with port operations goals.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Leased area increase:** 32,881 square feet\n- **Rent increase:** 18.9% ($48,974 annually), from approximately $259,073 to $308,047\n- **Permit term:** No extension—the permit still expires in March 2037\n- **Financial impact:** No impact to the city's General Fund\n- **Committee vote:** 2 yes (Buscaino, Krekorian), 1 absent (Bonin)\n\n## Impact\n\nThis action benefits Port operations and generates increased revenue for the Harbor Department while enabling Catalina Channel Express to expand its freight operations. No community impact statement was submitted for this matter.",
