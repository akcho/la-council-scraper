  "summary": "# Summary: REAP Property Removal Recommendation\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD) is requesting City Council approval to remove three residential properties from the Rent Escrow Account Program (REAP) and terminate rent reductions for tenants at these properties. The three properties are located in Los Angeles, Venice, and Gardena. The LAHD is asking for this matter to be heard at the November 5, 2025 City Council meeting.\n\n## Why?\n\nREAP is a code enforcement program that places properties into escrow when landlords fail to maintain safe housing conditions, which allows rent to be reduced and held in escrow until violations are corrected. LAHD is recommending removal because all three properties have successfully corrected the violations that caused their REAP placement. The properties have met all requirements under Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 162.08, all utility charges have been paid, and independent verification confirms the work is complete.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe three properties and case numbers are: (1) 10520 W Eastborne Ave, Los Angeles (Case 858268); (2) 2300 S Pisani Pl, Venice (Case 573692); and (3) 837 W 165th Pl, Gardena (Case 811138—a 10-unit building with 32 initial violations involving maintenance, electrical, and illegal construction issues). The Gardena property's case opened January 16, 2025.\n\n## Impact\n\nIf approved, tenants' rent will be restored to original levels 30 days after notice, and escrow funds will be released to pay administrative fees and penalties, with remaining funds returned to the landlord. This ends rent reductions for affected tenants at these three properties.",
