  "summary": "# Summary: Technical Correction to Senior Park Ranger MOU Designation\n\n## What is Being Proposed\nThe City Administrative Officer is requesting a technical correction to Ordinance No. 188307 to fix an error in which labor union (MOU) represents Senior Park Ranger I and II positions. The correction changes the union designation from MOU 12 to MOU 65 for both class codes (1967-1 and 1967-2).\n\n## Why This Correction is Needed\nWhen the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 188307 on July 2, 2024, the Senior Park Ranger positions were mistakenly assigned to MOU 12 instead of the correct union designation, MOU 65. This administrative error needs to be corrected to ensure proper union representation for these city employees.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Original Ordinance:** No. 188307 (C.F. 24-0777), adopted July 2, 2024, effective July 20, 2024\n- **Positions Affected:** Senior Park Ranger I (Class Code 1967-1) and Senior Park Ranger II (Class Code 1967-2)\n- **Correction Period:** Retroactively applied from June 30, 2024 through July 1, 2028\n- **Sent to:** Kenneth Mejia, Controller, for implementation\n\n## Impact\nThis correction ensures that Senior Park Rangers are properly represented by the correct union (MOU 65) and helps resolve any administrative or payroll issues that may have resulted from the initial misclassification. The change is retroactive, meaning it corrects records back to June 30, 2024.",
