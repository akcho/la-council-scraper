  "summary": "# Summary: Motion #54 - Downtown Industrial BID Renewal Support\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Council is being asked to instruct the City Clerk to sign a petition to renew the Downtown Industrial Business Improvement District (BID). Specifically, the motion directs the City Clerk to sign the petition on behalf of City-owned parcels located within the proposed BID renewal boundaries.\n\n## Why?\nThe City has historically supported business improvement districts in areas where the City owns property. Since the City owns several parcels within the proposed Downtown Industrial BID renewal area, the motion argues it should follow this precedent by formally supporting the petition. This support helps strengthen the renewal effort required by State Law.\n\n## Key Details\nThe Downtown Industrial BID provides three main program areas: (1) Clean and Safe services; (2) Economic Development and Marketing; and (3) Management Fees/Continuity. The BID's goals include improving safety on assessed parcels, increasing building occupancy and lease rates, encouraging new business development, and attracting ancillary businesses and services to the district. The motion also authorizes the City Clerk to make adjustments as needed to carry out the motion's intent.\n\n## Impact\nThis motion affects property owners and businesses in the Downtown Industrial area by supporting the continuation of BID services and programs. Residents and workers in this district benefit from the safety, marketing, and economic development initiatives funded by the BID. The motion was presented by Councilmember Ysabel Jurado (14th District) on October 31, 2025.",
