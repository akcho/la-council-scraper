  "summary": "# Summary: Council File 25-1107 - Public Convenience or Necessity Application for Dr G.\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nAn application has been filed for a \"Public Convenience or Necessity\" permit to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages at a restaurant called Dr G., located at 11302 West Santa Monica Boulevard in Council District 11. This type of permit is a special authorization that allows an establishment to sell alcohol when it may not otherwise qualify under standard zoning or licensing requirements.\n\n## Why This Matters?\nThe Public Convenience or Necessity process exists to allow the City Council to approve alcohol sales in specific cases where they determine the public would benefit from such a license. This is typically requested when a location doesn't meet standard criteria but the applicant argues there is community need or benefit.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** 11302 West Santa Monica Boulevard (Council District 11)\n- **Establishment:** Dr G.\n- **Council File Number:** 25-1107\n- **Hearing Date:** Tentatively scheduled for November 4, 2025\n- **Application Materials:** Available on the City Clerk's website at lacouncilfile.com\n\n## Who This Affects\nResidents in the West Los Angeles area (CD 11) will be most directly affected by this decision. Interested parties—including neighbors, community organizations, or the applicant—can submit comments or reports to the City Clerk by October 28, 2025 (one week before the hearing).",
