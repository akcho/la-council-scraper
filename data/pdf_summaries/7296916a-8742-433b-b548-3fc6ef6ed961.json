  "summary": "# Summary: Todd A. Bouey Appointment as LACERS General Manager\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\nThe Personnel and Hiring Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council approve and confirm Todd A. Bouey as the permanent General Manager of the Los Angeles Employees' Retirement System (LACERS). This appointment requires confirmation by both the Mayor and City Council under the City Charter.\n\n## Background and Process\nOn August 26, 2025, the LACERS Board of Administration appointed Bouey to this position, subject to Mayor and Council approval. The Mayor subsequently approved the appointment on September 23, 2025. The Personnel and Hiring Committee reviewed the appointment on October 24, 2025, held a public comment period, and voted to recommend approval. The matter now goes to the full City Council for final action.\n\n## Committee Vote and Details\nThe committee voted 2-1 on the recommendation, with Councilmembers McOsker and Rodriguez voting yes, and Soto-Martinez absent. Notably, neither the LACERS Board, the Mayor, the City Administrative Officer, nor the Chief Legislative Analyst submitted fiscal or community impact statements for this appointment.\n\n## Who This Affects\nThis appointment affects Los Angeles city employees who are LACERS members, as the General Manager oversees the retirement system that manages their pension benefits and retirement funds. The appointment is not yet official and requires City Council action to become final.",
