  "summary": "# Summary: Mixed-Use Housing Development Appeal at Melrose and Harper Avenues\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nEva Nathanson has filed an appeal challenging the Los Angeles City Planning Commission's approval of a mixed-use development project at 8251-8271 West Melrose Avenue and 705-711 North Harper Avenue. The project involves demolishing four commercial buildings and a surface parking lot to construct a six-story, 90-unit residential building with 15,271 square feet of commercial space. The Planning Commission approved density bonus incentives that allow the developer to reduce open space requirements from 9,800 to 7,840 square feet.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe appeal will be heard by the Planning and Land Use Management (PLUM) Committee of the Los Angeles City Council on October 28, 2025. The committee must review the Planning Commission's approval of both the Density Bonus/Affordable Housing Incentive Program and the Project Review. The project includes 10 units restricted for very low-income households, addressing the city's need for affordable housing, though the appellant (represented by attorney Andrew Sachs) disputes whether the project meets all requirements.\n\n## Key Project Details\n\nThe 110,300 square-foot development will include 96 parking spaces across two subterranean levels, 94 bicycle parking spaces, and 7,840 square feet of open space. The building stands 69 feet tall with a Floor Area Ratio of 4.52:1. The project is located in Council District 5 and will require excavation of approximately 20,194 cubic yards of soil. Environmental review has been completed under CEQA (Class 32 Categorical Exemption).\n\n## Who Is Affected\n\nResidents within a 300-foot radius, the applicant (David Pourbaba/TOVA LLC), and interested parties are invited to testify. Written comments can be submitted through the Public Comment Portal (www.LACouncilComment.com) before October 28, 2025. Any judicial challenge must be filed within 90 days of the City Council's final action.",
