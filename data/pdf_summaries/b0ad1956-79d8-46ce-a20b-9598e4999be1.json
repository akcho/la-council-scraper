  "summary": "# Summary: Fourth Amendment to Catalina Channel Express Permit (File 12-0344)\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles Harbor Department is seeking City Council approval to amend an existing permit (Permit No. 897) with Catalina Channel Express, Inc., a ferry service operator. The amendment makes retroactive changes to how the company compensates the city for using harbor facilities. Specifically, it updates the permit language effective July 25, 2023, and increases the company's minimum annual rent payment starting July 25, 2024.\n\n## Why This Amendment?\n\nThe document does not explicitly state why these retroactive changes are necessary. However, the amendment appears designed to ensure fair compensation to the city and clarify the terms under which Catalina Channel Express operates at the harbor. The retroactive nature suggests these changes may address a gap or dispute regarding how the company's rent should have been calculated.\n\n## Key Financial Details\n\n- **Minimum annual rent increases by $146,456** (from $497,596 to $644,052), effective July 25, 2024 through July 24, 2029\n- **Percentage rent added**: 5% of gross receipts exceeding the fixed minimum rent, plus 2% of freight-related revenue exceeding the minimum\n- All revenue goes to the Harbor Revenue Fund\n- The minimum rent will adjust annually based on the Consumer Price Index\n\n## Impact\n\nThe changes primarily affect Catalina Channel Express through increased operating costs. Residents benefit through higher city revenues from a major ferry operator serving Catalina Island. The Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee unanimously approved the amendment on October 14, 2025, with no negative community impact statements submitted.",
