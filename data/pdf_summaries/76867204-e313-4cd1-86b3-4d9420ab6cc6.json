  "summary": "# Summary: Change of Control Consent for Delaware North Airport Concessions\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City of Los Angeles Department of Airports is approving the change of ownership for two food and beverage concession operations at LAX: DN Dakota/JME LAX 8589 Farmers, LLC and DN Dakota/JME LAX 8549 Pucks, LLC. AREAS USA, Inc. is acquiring these operations from Delaware North Companies, Incorporated through a stock purchase transaction dated July 9, 2025. This change of control requires the City's formal consent before the ownership transfer can take effect.\n\n## Why?\n\nChange of control provisions are standard in airport concession agreements to ensure continuity of service and protect the City's interests. The City must verify that new operators will maintain service quality, comply with all existing contract terms, and meet all regulatory requirements. This consent document establishes that all original concession agreement obligations remain in force regardless of ownership change.\n\n## Key Details\n\n**Locations:** Terminal 5 Units 5H, 5R, 5T (Farmers); Terminal 5 Unit 5C and Terminal 7 Unit 7D (Pucks) at LAX\n\n**Transaction Date:** July 9, 2025\n\n**Buyer:** AREAS USA, Inc. (CEO Carlos Bernal, Miami, FL)\n\n**Previous Owner:** Delaware North Companies, Incorporated\n\n**Guarantor:** AREAS S.A.U. reaffirms its guarantee of all concession obligations\n\n**Refurbishment Commitments:** Buyer must complete Wolfgang Puck T7 renovations by December 31, 2026, and Wahoos Terminal 6 rebranding by June 30, 2027, with failure constituting material default.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis approval allows AREAS USA to assume operation of these popular airport restaurants. Residents and travelers will likely see continued dining service with planned renovations and upgrades to certain locations. The City protects itself through cross-default provisions that allow termination if the new operator breaches any other City contracts or fails to maintain compliance with hazardous substance and safety regulations already in place.",
