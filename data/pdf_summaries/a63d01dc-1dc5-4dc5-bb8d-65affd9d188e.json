  "summary": "# Summary: 2024-2029 Non-Represented Employee Salary Schedule (2nd Revision)\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThis document establishes salary ranges for non-represented City of Los Angeles employees from June 30, 2024, through July 1, 2028. It provides a comprehensive pay schedule for over 300 job classifications, including administrative staff, technicians, analysts, and various support positions. The document shows regular salary increases scheduled on specific dates throughout this period.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe salary schedule ensures competitive compensation for city workers who are not part of a union bargaining unit. Regular scheduled increases help with employee retention, cost-of-living adjustments, and maintain the city's ability to recruit qualified staff for critical positions across multiple departments and agencies.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Timeframe**: Eight pay periods from June 30, 2024, to July 1, 2028\n- **Salary Increases**: Generally occur every six months, with increases typically ranging from 2-5% per adjustment\n- **Job Classifications**: Covers positions from entry-level trainees (starting around $17-23/hour or ~$1,600-2,500 monthly) to executive-level roles (reaching $11,000-13,000+ monthly)\n- **Notable Positions**: Includes Executive Director roles, Chiefs, Analysts, and specialized technical positions across city departments\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects hundreds of non-union city employees' paychecks and budgeting. Residents indirectly bear the cost through city budget allocations, while affected employees receive clarity on their compensation trajectory. The schedule helps ensure the city can retain experienced staff in administrative, technical, and professional roles essential to city services.",
