  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 21-1330\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Energy and Environment Committee is recommending that the City Council authorize the Board of Public Works to execute Amendment No. 2 to an existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Discovery Cube Los Angeles (DCLA). This amendment would formalize the Bureau of Sanitation's (BOS) role in developing, promoting, and assisting with environmental events and programs in partnership with DCLA.\n\n## Why?\nThe amendment builds on an existing partnership between the City and DCLA to expand environmental education and programming. The arrangement allows the City to leverage DCLA's resources and expertise in science education while advancing the City's environmental goals through public outreach and community engagement initiatives.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Funding**: $900,000 total contribution split between two sources: $900,000 from the General City Purposes Fund and an additional $900,000 from BOS operational funds ($450,000 from Sewer Operations and Maintenance, $450,000 from Solid Waste Resources Revenue Fund)\n- **Timeline**: Committee approved on November 3, 2023; Council deadline for action is December 15, 2023\n- **No additional General Fund impact** as the $900,000 General Fund contribution was already budgeted for the 2023-24 Adopted Budget\n\n## Impact\nThis partnership expands the City's environmental education reach to Los Angeles residents through DCLA programming while supporting the Bureau of Sanitation's mission. The committee found the proposal complies with City Financial Policies and received Committee approval with four votes in favor and one absence.",
