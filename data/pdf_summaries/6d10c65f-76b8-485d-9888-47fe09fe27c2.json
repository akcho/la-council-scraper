  "summary": "# Summary: Request for Closed Session - Settlement Discussion\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Attorney's office is requesting that the City Council hold a closed session to discuss and receive legal advice regarding settlement negotiations in a pending litigation case: *Mitsuo Kato v. City of Los Angeles* (LASC Case No. 22SCV29172, Claim No. C22-20314).\n\n## Why?\nThis request is made under California Government Code Section 54956.9(d)(1), which permits public agencies to hold closed sessions when conferring with legal counsel about pending litigation. The closed session allows the City to discuss settlement strategy and receive confidential legal advice without public disclosure, which is protected by attorney-client privilege.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Incident:** A fall incident occurred on December 12, 2021, at 8333 Lookout Mountain Road, Los Angeles\n- **Contact:** Deputy City Attorney Joshua A. Quinones (213-645-9988) will answer questions and attend the session\n- **Report Number:** R25-0497 (dated October 9, 2025)\n\n## Impact\nThis closed session enables the City Council to receive confidential legal guidance on how to proceed with this personal injury claim. The settlement discussion could affect the City's financial liability and risk exposure. Once the case is resolved, the settlement terms may become public record, but the negotiation process itself remains confidential to protect the City's legal position.",
