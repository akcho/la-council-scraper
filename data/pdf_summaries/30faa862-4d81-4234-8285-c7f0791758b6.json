  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 24-0777\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Personnel and Hiring Committee is recommending the adoption of ordinances that would cancel and reduce previously scheduled salary increases for non-represented (non-union) city employees in the offices of the City Council and Mayor. Specifically, the ordinances would remove a 4% salary increase scheduled for June 29, 2025, for Council positions (Council Aide I-VII and related positions) and cancel multiple salary increases scheduled for June 29, 2025, December 28, 2025, and June 28, 2026, for Mayor's office positions (Chief of Staff, Deputy Mayor, and Mayoral Aide I-VIII).\n\n## Why?\n\nThe document does not explicitly state the rationale for these salary reductions, but the context suggests this is a fiscal constraint measure. The city appears to be addressing budget pressures by freezing scheduled compensation increases for executive-level and administrative staff in both the Council and Mayor's offices.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Affected employees**: Non-represented positions in City Council and Mayor's offices\n- **Dates of cancelled increases**: June 29, 2025 (Council); June 29, December 28, 2025, and June 28, 2026 (Mayor)\n- **Estimated savings**: $3 million in FY 2025-26, $4.5 million in FY 2026-27, and $4.8 million in FY 2027-28\n- **Committee vote**: Unanimous approval (McOsker, Rodriguez, Hutt all voted YES on 6/18/25)\n\n## Impact\n\nThese salary reductions will affect approximately 50-60 executive and administrative staff members across the two offices while generating approximately $12.3 million in General Fund savings over three fiscal years.",
