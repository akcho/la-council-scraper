  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 21-1330\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to authorize the Board of Public Works to execute an amendment to an existing partnership agreement (Memorandum of Understanding) with Discovery Cube Los Angeles. The amendment would extend the organization's operational support and enable it to develop, promote, and assist with environmental events and programs run by the Bureau of Sanitation.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe document does not provide extensive background in this committee report, though it references an October 4, 2022 Bureau of Sanitation report that contains more details. The partnership aims to support environmental education and public engagement through the Discovery Cube, a science-focused institution in Los Angeles.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe City will provide **$1.8 million in total funding** for 2022-23:\n- **$900,000** from the General City Purposes Fund\n- **$900,000** from the Bureau of Sanitation (split between the Sewer Operations & Maintenance Fund ($450,000) and Solid Waste Resources Revenue Fund ($450,000))\n\nThe funding has already been appropriated in the city's adopted budget. All three committee members (O'Farrell, Koretz, and Krekorian) voted \"YES\" on November 3, 2022. The council deadline for action is **December 2, 2022**.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis partnership supports environmental education and public programming in Los Angeles. The funding comes from existing city budgets with no additional General Fund impact, and the committee found it complies with the City's Financial Policies.",
