  "summary": "# Summary: City Attorney Request for Closed Session - Settlement Discussion\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Attorney's office is requesting that the City Council hold a closed session to discuss potential settlement of a pending lawsuit. Specifically, they are asking the Council to meet in private to confer with legal counsel regarding the Archangel Augustine v. City of Los Angeles case (LASC Case No. 23STC15263) and receive legal advice about a Claims Board action recommendation related to this litigation.\n\n## Why?\nThis closed session is being requested under California Government Code Section 54956.9(d)(1), which allows public agencies to meet in private when discussing pending litigation with their legal counsel. The case involves a July 1, 2021 incident where the plaintiff tripped and fell on a sidewalk at 5700 South Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles. A settlement discussion requires confidentiality to protect the City's legal negotiating position and ensure candid legal advice.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Case:** Archangel Augustine v. City of Los Angeles\n- **Incident Date:** July 1, 2021\n- **Location:** 5700 South Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles\n- **Claim Number:** C22-03790\n- **Contact:** Dikran Sassounian, Assistant Chief, Civil Litigation Branch, (213) 978-8335\n\n## Impact\nThis affects City Council members who need to authorize the settlement discussion and potentially vote on settlement terms later. The public will not participate in the closed session but may learn of settlement outcomes in future public meetings. This is a routine legal procedure for managing liability claims against the City.",
