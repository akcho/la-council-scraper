  "summary": "# Summary: Second Amendment to ASPCA Spay/Neuter Clinic Contract\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City is seeking to extend its contract with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) to continue operating the spay and neuter clinic at the Chesterfield Square Animal Services Center in South Los Angeles. Specifically, the City Administrative Officer recommends authorizing a one-year extension of the existing contract from July 1, 2025 through June 30, 2026, for a maximum amount of $350,000.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe City's Animal Services Department has relied on this partnership to provide accessible spay and neuter services to shelter animals and low-income Los Angeles residents. Although the City employs veterinarians and veterinary technicians capable of performing these surgeries, staffing limitations and the high volume of animals needing care make it more practical to contract with ASPCA. This arrangement also helps facilitate pet adoptions by ensuring animals are sterilized before release to new owners and supports the City's discount and free sterilization voucher programs for residents.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** Chesterfield Square Animal Services Center (1850 West 60th Street, South Los Angeles)\n- **Duration:** July 1, 2025 - June 30, 2026 (final one-year option; this is the second amendment)\n- **Cost:** $350,000 maximum for this year; total contract value reached $1,750,000 across the original three-year term plus two one-year extensions\n- **Funding:** Animal Sterilization Trust Fund (supported by licensing fees, adoption fees, and donations—no General Fund impact)\n- **Services:** Spay/neuter surgeries for dogs, cats, and rabbits; includes pre-adoption, post-release, and discount/free programs for residents\n\n## Impact\n\nThis extension ensures continued access to affordable sterilization services for adoptive families and low-income Los Angeles residents, supporting animal welfare and adoption outcomes. The contract has operated successfully since June 2021 with full compliance with City requirements and professional standards.",
