  "summary": "# Summary: Reappointment of Vivian Garcia to Native American Indian Commission\n\n## What is Being Proposed\nMayor Karen Bass is requesting City Council confirmation to reappoint Vivian Garcia to the Los Angeles City-County Native American Indian Commission for a four-year term ending October 7, 2029. This is a reappointment, as Ms. Garcia's current term expires on October 7, 2025.\n\n## Why\nThe Mayor certifies that Ms. Garcia is \"especially qualified by reason of training and experience\" for this position and that the appointment is made \"solely in the interest of the City.\" Garcia brings significant expertise in tribal relations, community outreach, and serving Los Angeles's urban Native American population.\n\n## Key Details\nMs. Garcia is a proud Cherokee citizen and current Tribal & Community Liaison for United American Indian Involvement (UAII). She holds a Master's degree in Early Childhood Education and a Bachelor's degree in American Indian Studies from UCLA. Her professional background includes direct services to vulnerable children and families, care coordination, and community advocacy. The Commission currently has five members, all identifying as Native American, representing different City Council districts and regions.\n\n## Impact\nThis reappointment maintains continuity on the commission that advises the City on Native American Indian matters and policy. The confirmation process requires Ms. Garcia to complete background checks, meet with Councilmembers, and appear at committee and full Council hearings before final approval. Commission Affairs staff will support her through the confirmation timeline.",
