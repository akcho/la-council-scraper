  "summary": "# Summary: LA28 Closing Ceremonies Relocation\n\n## What is Being Proposed\n\nThe Ad Hoc Committee on the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council approve relocating both the Olympic and Paralympic Games Closing Ceremonies to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Previously, these closing ceremonies were planned to be held at multiple venues—the Coliseum and the Stadium in Inglewood.\n\n## The Change\n\n**Olympic Games Closing Ceremony:** Will move from being split between the Coliseum and Inglewood Stadium to **solely the Coliseum**.\n\n**Paralympic Games Closing Ceremony:** Will move from Inglewood Stadium to **the Coliseum**.\n\n## Committee Action\n\nOn October 29, 2025, the committee voted 6-0 to approve this recommendation (with one member absent). The motion originated from Council Members Price and Harris-Dawson. The committee held a public comment period before voting to forward the recommendation to the full City Council for final approval.\n\n## Current Status\n\nThis recommendation is not yet official and requires full City Council action to be implemented. Notably, neither the City Administrative Officer nor the Chief Legislative Analyst has completed a financial analysis of the proposal, and no community impact statement has been submitted.",
