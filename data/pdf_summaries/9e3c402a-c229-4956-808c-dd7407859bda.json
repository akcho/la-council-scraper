  "summary": "# Summary: Bureau of Street Lighting 3D Printing Project Funding\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Council is being asked to approve $150,000 in funding from the Innovation Fund (IF) to support the Bureau of Street Lighting's (BSL) 3D Printing for the Public Right-of-Way Project. This involves establishing a new appropriation account and transferring the money to the BSL's operational budget for street lighting improvements and supplies.\n\n## Why?\nThe document indicates this is part of the city's innovation initiatives to improve government efficiency. The Government Efficiency, Innovation, and Audits Committee reviewed a City Administrative Officer (CAO) report and determined the project aligns with the city's financial policies. However, the CAO noted this funding may result in unfunded and ongoing costs, and will reduce the available Innovation Fund balance from $2,768,922.75 to approximately $2,618,922.75.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Funding Amount:** $150,000\n- **Source:** Innovation Fund No. 105/10\n- **Committee Vote:** Unanimous approval (Rodriguez, Blumenfield, and Mcosker all voted YES on October 17, 2025)\n- **Requirements:** The BSL must separately track all spending, report to the Innovation and Performance Commission about lessons learned and obstacles, and acknowledge the IPC in public materials related to the project.\n\n## Impact\nThis funding supports street lighting innovation in public right-of-way areas, though the document does not specify the exact nature of the 3D printing application. Any unspent funds must be returned to the Innovation Fund at fiscal year's end. The city notes this allocation reduces available emergency funds during a current citywide financial crisis.",
