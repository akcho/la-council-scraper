  "summary": "# Summary: Siegel House Historic-Cultural Monument Designation\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles City Council's Planning and Land Use Management (PLUM) Committee is considering the inclusion of Siegel House, located at 12400 West Deerbrook Lane, in the city's list of Historic-Cultural Monuments. This action follows a report from the Cultural Heritage Commission recommending the designation.\n\n## Why?\nThe property is being evaluated for historical and cultural significance under California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines. The Cultural Heritage Commission has determined the property warrants protection as a historic-cultural monument, which would preserve its architectural or historical importance for future generations.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Public Hearing Date:** Tuesday, October 28, 2025 at approximately 2:00 P.M.\n- **Location:** John Ferraro Council Chamber, Room 340, City Hall, 200 North Spring Street, Los Angeles, CA 90012\n- **Council File:** 25-1110\n- **Property Owner:** James Sewell and Natasha Wellesley Miller\n- **Applicant/Architect:** Cory Buckner\n- **District:** Council District 11\n- **Environmental Review:** Categorical Exemption under CEQA Class 8 and Class 31\n\n## Impact\nProperty owners, neighbors, and interested parties have the opportunity to comment on the proposed designation. The public hearing will allow residents to voice support or opposition. If approved, the monument designation would restrict certain modifications to the property and provide it with historical protection status.",
