  "summary": "# Summary: ASPCA Contract for Chesterfield Square Animal Services Spay/Neuter Clinic\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Personnel, Audits, and Animal Welfare Committee recommends that Los Angeles City Council authorize a three-year contract with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) to operate the spay/neuter clinic at the Chesterfield Square Animal Services Center. The contract runs from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2024, with an option to extend for two additional one-year periods.\n\n## Background and Rationale\nThe Department of Animal Services established an on-call list of qualified spay/neuter service providers in September 2020, following a competitive Request for Qualifications process. The ASPCA was selected from this list through a formal Task Order Solicitations (TOS) process. This contract is part of the city's cost containment efforts to maintain spay/neuter services at animal shelters, similar to an earlier agreement with ASPCA for the West Los Angeles Animal Services Center clinic.\n\n## Key Financial and Operational Details\nThe contract is valued at $350,000 annually, totaling $1,050,000 for the initial three-year term. Importantly, this expenditure will have **no impact on the city's General Fund**, as funding comes entirely from the Animal Sterilization Trust Fund. The Committee reviewed the proposal on May 19, 2021, and voted to recommend approval (with support from Council members Koretz and Bonin; Harris-Dawson was absent).\n\n## Impact\nThis contract ensures continued spay/neuter services at a major animal facility, supporting animal welfare initiatives without burdening the city's general budget. The agreement must still be approved by the City Attorney and the full City Council before taking effect.",
