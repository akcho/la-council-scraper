  "summary": "# Summary: Public Comment on Housing Relief for Council File 23-1134\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nMatilda Paulin submitted public comment requesting the Los Angeles City Council enact comprehensive housing relief measures for working-class and struggling families. Her proposal includes five main policy recommendations: (1) universal rent control applying to all rental units with vacancy control protections; (2) creation and expansion of social housing that is publicly owned, democratically controlled, and permanently affordable; (3) conversion of existing properties to social housing through community land trusts; (4) investment in new public housing construction; and (5) enhanced tenant protections including universal bills of rights, expanded just cause eviction protections, accessibility requirements, and cancellation of COVID-19-related rent debt.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nPaulin articulates a crisis of housing affordability in Los Angeles, noting that many working-class residents live \"one or two paychecks away from being unhoused\" due to rising rents. She argues that current Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) protections are insufficient. The comment emphasizes the need to repeal state laws that limit rent control options (California's Costa-Hawkins Act) and federal restrictions on public housing construction (the Faircloth Amendment).\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe comment was submitted on July 25, 2025, and references existing RSO laws as inadequate protections. Paulin identifies specific statutory barriers to her proposed solutions, indicating this relates to broader policy discussions within Council File 23-1134.\n\n## Impact\n\nThese recommendations would directly affect renters throughout Los Angeles, particularly low-income households and disabled individuals, by potentially reducing housing costs, increasing tenant rights, and expanding permanently affordable housing options.",
