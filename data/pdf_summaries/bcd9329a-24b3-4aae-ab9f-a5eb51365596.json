  "summary": "# Summary: Tiny Home Village Lease Agreement at Sierra Vista Avenue\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to approve a lease agreement with GMA - Sierra Vista, LLC and Sierra Vista-Y, LLC to operate a Tiny Home Village (THV) at 5301 Sierra Vista Avenue in Council District 13. This interim housing facility would provide 51 beds for homeless individuals and function as a low-barrier navigation center. The lease would be for 36 months with two optional one-year extensions.\n\n## Why?\n\nThis project addresses the city's homelessness crisis as part of the Alliance Settlement Agreement, which requires the city to provide supportive housing. The project is also being fast-tracked through CEQA environmental review exemptions because it qualifies as emergency housing to prevent or mitigate the homelessness emergency.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** 5301 Sierra Vista Avenue, Council District 13\n- **Capacity:** 51 beds\n- **Lease Term:** 3 years with two 1-year renewal options\n- **Operator:** GMA - Sierra Vista, LLC and Sierra Vista-Y, LLC\n- **Contingency:** The lease depends on the nonprofit Dignity Moves executing a contract with the Bureau of Engineering to construct and develop the site\n- **Timeline:** This is a time-limit file with March 5, 2025 deadline (document shows approval occurred April 1, 2025)\n\n## Impact & Fiscal Effects\n\nBoth the Housing and Homelessness Committee and Budget and Finance Committee unanimously approved this proposal. The city will not incur costs through Fiscal Year 2025-26, but will face potential General Fund expenses starting in Fiscal Year 2026-27 to support the lease operations.",
