  "summary": "# Summary: CEQA Appeal of Melrose/Harper Development Project\n\n## What is Being Appealed?\n\nEva Nathanson (property owner) and Andrew Sachs (tenant) at 715 N. Harper Avenue are appealing the City Planning Commission's August 6, 2025 decision to grant a categorical exemption from California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review for a proposed development at 8251-8271 W. Melrose Ave. and 705-711 N. Harper Ave. The appellants argue that a full environmental review—either a Mitigated Negative Declaration or Environmental Impact Report—should be required instead of the streamlined categorical exemption.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe appellants contend that the project poses significant environmental and safety risks that were not adequately studied. Their primary concerns include: (1) structural damage risk from large-scale excavation (approximately 20,194 cubic yards) in an area with a high water table—they cite prior damage to their own property from nearby excavation; (2) traffic and emergency access problems, as Harper Avenue already suffers from congestion and illegal parking that could be worsened by the project's new driveway and loading dock; (3) air quality and noise impacts on sensitive receptors, including elderly residents and a senior care facility (Shalom Gardens) just 30 feet away; and (4) cumulative impacts from multiple mid-rise projects in the area that have never been analyzed together.\n\n## Key Legal Arguments\n\nThe appellants cite recent California court decisions—particularly *United Neighborhoods v. City of Los Angeles* (2023)—requiring the City to analyze consistency with all applicable General Plan policies (Mobility, Safety, Noise, Air Quality, Housing Elements), not just land use policies. They argue the City's analysis was incomplete and relied on generic compliance statements rather than project-specific studies. Under the \"unusual circumstances\" exception to categorical exemptions, they contend the combination of high groundwater, adjacency to older structures with settlement damage, and location on a critical emergency access street should bar the exemption.\n\n## What They're Asking For\n\nThe appellants request that the City Council (1) grant the appeal and set aside the categorical exemption; (2) prohibit demolition and construction until independent experts complete cumulative environmental and traffic studies; (3) prepare a full Environmental Impact Report; (4) require the developer to name their property as additionally insured on the construction insurance policy; and (5) implement relief measures to protect their property during any approved construction.",
