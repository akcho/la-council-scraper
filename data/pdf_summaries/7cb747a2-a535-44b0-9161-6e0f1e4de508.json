  "summary": "# Summary: Community Impact Statement - Council File 23-1376-S1\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Westside Neighborhood Council has submitted a Community Impact Statement (CIS) supporting Council File #23-1376-S1. The council voted to support the item and requested an evaluation and report on the status of an advertising contract with a comparable cities analysis to maximize revenue potential.\n\n## Why?\nThe Westside Neighborhood Council determined this matter warrants community input and formal positions through the CIS process, which is enabled under Los Angeles Administrative Code §Section 22.819. This mechanism allows neighborhood councils to formally communicate their positions on matters before City Boards and Commissions, ensuring community voices are included in municipal decision-making.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Council File Number:** 23-1376-S1\n- **Neighborhood Council:** Westside\n- **Contact:** Joseph Roth (wncseat18@gmail.com)\n- **Board Vote:** Yes(13), Nay(0), Abstain(0), Ineligible(0), Recusal(0)\n- **Vote Date:** February 13, 2025\n- **CIS Submission Date:** February 15, 2025\n\n## Impact\nThis CIS supports the City Council's directive to evaluate and report on the advertising contract's performance against comparable cities. The action aims to ensure the city is optimizing its advertising revenue potential, which could affect city budgets and services funded through such revenue streams.",
