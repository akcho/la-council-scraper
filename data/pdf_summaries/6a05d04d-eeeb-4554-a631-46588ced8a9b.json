  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 24-0777\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council has adopted ordinances to amend the salary schedules for non-represented (non-union) employees in the offices of the City Council and Mayor. Specifically, the action removes previously scheduled salary increases and implements adjusted lower salary ranges for these positions on future dates.\n\n## Why?\n\nWhile the document does not explicitly state the rationale, this type of action typically reflects budget constraints or fiscal management decisions. The removal of planned salary increases suggests the city is responding to budgetary pressures or adjusting compensation expectations for administrative staff.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Council Vote**: The measure passed with strong support (13 YES votes, 2 ABSENT, 0 NO votes) on June 24, 2025\n- **Affected Positions**: Non-represented classifications in the City Council and Mayor's offices\n- **Legal Basis**: Los Angeles Administrative Code Section 4.61, Schedule A\n- **Timeline**: The ordinance was sent to Mayor Karen Bass on June 25, 2025, with a deadline for mayoral action by July 7, 2025. The Mayor approved it on June 25, 2025\n\n## Impact\n\nThis decision affects administrative staff working in City Hall's legislative offices. These employees will experience reduced salary growth compared to what was previously scheduled, meaning lower take-home pay and reduced future earning potential for these city workers.",
