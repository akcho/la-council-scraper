The zoning change allows for residential development on approximately 205 feet of frontage along Chase Street and Penfield Avenue, with a maximum of five dwelling units permitted on the site.\n\n## Why?\nThe zoning change implements an approved subdivision (Vesting Tentative Tract Map No. 83673-SL-HCA) and reflects a plan submitted by the applicant for development of the property. The qualified conditions ensure that development proceeds in a manner compatible with the surrounding neighborhood while protecting environmental resources and maintaining quality of life standards.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** Chase Street and Penfield Avenue, Chatsworth-Porter Ranch area\n- **Case Number:** APCNV-2022-8497-VZC\n- **Maximum Density:** 5 dwelling units\n- **North Valley Area Planning Commission Recommendation:** BE ADOPTED (recommended July 3, 2025)\n- **Key Conditions:** Protection of six non-protected trees and one protected Sambucus mexicana tree; landscaping requirements; mechanical equipment screening; outdoor lighting restrictions\n\n## Impact\nThis zoning change affects the property owner/developer by allowing residential development under specific conditions.
