  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 12-0344\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Trade, Commerce and Tourism Committee recommends that the Los Angeles City Council approve Permit No. 897 for Catalina Channel Express, Inc. This permit would authorize the ferry company to construct, operate, and maintain a public passenger facility at San Pedro's Berths 94 and 95 for 25 years. The committee also recommends adopting a California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) exemption for this project.\n\n## Why?\nCatalina Express must relocate from its current location at Berths 95/96 to make room for the expansion of the China Shipping terminal. The relocation is necessary to prevent delays to the China Shipping expansion project, which could subject the Harbor Department to financial penalties. To accommodate this move as quickly as possible, Catalina Express is making a substantial $2.8 million investment in facility improvements at the new location.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Current location:** Berths 95/96 (170,678 square feet)\n- **New location:** Berths 94/95\n- **Current permit:** No. 768 (being replaced by Permit No. 897)\n- **Term:** 25 years\n- **Investment:** Approximately $2.8 million\n- **Committee vote:** 2-1 approval (Labonge and Rosendahl voted yes; Buscaino was absent)\n- **Deadline for Council action:** April 4, 2012\n\n## Impact\nThe approval allows Catalina Express to continue operating passenger ferry service between San Pedro and Catalina Island, serving tourists and commuters. There is no fiscal impact to the City General Fund. The relocation enables important port expansion while maintaining an existing transportation service.",
