  "summary": "# Summary: Vacation of L-Shaped Alley at Olympic Boulevard and Mateo Street\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Office of the City Engineer is initiating a formal vacation proceeding to remove an L-shaped alley located northerly of Olympic Boulevard and westerly of Mateo Street from the city's public street system. This follows an application submitted by David Evans and Associates on January 22, 2019. The document recommends that the Bureau of Engineering investigate the feasibility of this vacation and, if approved by the Public Works and Gang Reduction Committee, schedule it for full City Council consideration with a required public hearing.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe petitioner, David Evans and Associates, wants to vacate this alley so they can utilize the space to serve existing adjacent properties. The alley is no longer needed as public right-of-way, and vacating it would allow the petitioner to incorporate it into their private development or property use.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Petition fee paid**: $14,980.00 by the petitioner to cover investigation costs\n- **File reference**: VAC E1401355, Council District 14\n- **Date of report**: February 13, 2019\n- **Legal basis**: California Streets and Highways Code, Division 9, Part 3\n- **Next steps**: Bureau of Engineering feasibility study, followed by committee review and public hearing before Council consideration\n\n## Impact\n\nThis process is preliminary and does not constitute approval—it only initiates the investigation phase. If approved, the vacation would remove public access to this alley and transfer it to private control, potentially affecting nearby residents or businesses. The public hearing requirement ensures community input before any final decision.",
