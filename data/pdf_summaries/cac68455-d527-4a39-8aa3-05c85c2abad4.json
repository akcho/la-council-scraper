  "summary": "# Summary: Communications Regarding RSO Rent Increase Formula (Council File 23-1134)\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nMultiple residents are urging the LA City Council to adopt the \"Keep LA Housed\" demands for reforming the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) rent increase formula. The proposed changes include: (1) basing rent increases on 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) All Items, (2) capping increases at 3% with no floor, (3) eliminating rent banking, and (4) removing bumps for utilities and additional occupants.\n\n## Why This Matters\nLA renters currently face unaffordable housing costs, with new rent increases based on the old formula having gone into effect in July 2025 (ranging from 3-5% increases). The average RSO unit rents for $2,357/month, requiring renters to earn approximately $94,000 annually to stay within the recommended 30% rent-to-income ratio. Residents report spending the majority of their income on rent, leaving insufficient funds for food, medical care, transportation, and childcare. The comments emphasize that current rent increases are unsustainable, particularly for vulnerable populations including immigrant families facing ICE enforcement and those displaced by recent fires or job losses.\n\n## Key Details\nAll four commenters submitted statements on August 3, 2025, making identical or near-identical demands. They cite the same data points and urgency, indicating coordinated advocacy. One commenter specifically highlights that over 30% of Asian American renters in Los Angeles face severe housing cost burdens, spending over half their income on rent alone.\n\n## Impact\nThis affects the majority of LA residents who are renters. If adopted, the proposed formula changes would significantly lower allowable rent increases, providing relief to struggling tenants while potentially limiting landlord income from rent increases on stabilized units.",
