  "summary": "# Summary: Killion Street and Vesper Avenue Street Lighting Assessment District\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Department of Public Works Bureau of Street Lighting is proposing to establish a new street lighting maintenance assessment district for Killion Street (from 280' to 430' west of Van Nuys Boulevard). The City Council is being asked to adopt an Ordinance of Intention to conduct a formal assessment proceeding that would require property owners in the district to pay annual maintenance assessments for the street lighting system.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe City finances approximately 80% of its street lighting system through maintenance assessments paid by benefiting properties, with the remainder funded by the Department of Water and Power. This proposed district would formalize financing for a street lighting system on Killion Street that provides \"special benefit\" to nearby properties by illuminating roadways and sidewalks for safety and community character. The assessment would cover costs of operation, maintenance, energy, and eventual replacement of the lighting equipment.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** Killion Street, 280' to 430' west of Van Nuys Boulevard (Council District 4)\n- **Properties Affected:** 4 parcels (2 multi-family residential, 2 single-family residential)\n- **Total Assessment:** $768.51 annually for all four properties combined\n- **Individual Assessments:** Range from $50.81 to $381.08 per property\n- **Tax Year:** 2025-2026\n- **Project Type:** Proposed private development project with 1 streetlight\n\n## Impact & Process\n\nThis proposal requires a weighted ballot vote by affected property owners under Proposition 218 protections—the assessment proceeds only if \"yes\" votes equal or exceed \"no\" votes when weighted by financial obligation. If approved, property owners will receive assessment ballots by mail. If rejected, the district will be abandoned and the lighting system removed or not constructed. A public hearing will be scheduled for property owners to present concerns or appeals.",
