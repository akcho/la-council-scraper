The committee held a public comment period before voting. The vote was 2-1 in favor (Hernandez and Hutt voted yes; Padilla was absent). The matter now moves forward to the full City Council for final consideration.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** West Sunset Boulevard and Lemoyne Street intersection\n- **Designation Name:** Sandra Figueroa-Villa Square\n- **Action Required:** City Council approval and Department of Transportation sign installation\n- **Financial Impact:** No fiscal analysis has been completed at this time\n\n## What This Means\n\nThis is a ceremonial designation that honors Sandra Figueroa-Villa by naming an intersection after her.

This type of action is a common way cities honor individuals for their contributions to the community.",
