  "summary": "# Summary: LADWP Open Access Transmission Tariff Amendments\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) is requesting City Council approval of two amendments to its Open Access Transmission Tariff (Amendment No. 5 and Amendment No. 6, identified as DWP No. BP 01-017). These amendments were previously approved by the Board of Water and Power Commissioners on September 22, 2025, through Resolution No. 026 050, and now require formal City Council approval to proceed.\n\n## Why?\nThe document does not provide detailed explanation of the rationale behind these specific amendments. However, the submission follows the required legal procedures outlined in Charter Section 674 and Los Angeles Administrative Code Section 23.134, which mandate that such tariff amendments receive approval from both the Board of Water and Power Commissioners and the City Council.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Date of Board Approval:** September 22, 2025\n- **Date Submitted to Council:** September 26, 2025\n- **Contact for Questions:** Mr. David Rahimian (213-367-0361) or Mr. Paul Habib (213-367-3846)\n- **Supporting Documents:** The submission includes General Manager Certificates (GMC No. 5 with Attachments A-E and GMC No. 6 with Attachments A-D), an ordinance, and a CAO Report\n\n## Impact\nThis tariff amendment would affect LADWP's open access transmission services, which impact the utility's ability to provide electricity transmission services. The specific effects on rates, customers, or operations are not detailed in this cover letter and would be contained in the attached General Manager Certificates and supporting documentation.",
