This means the City would officially close and potentially sell or transfer this public alley to private ownership.\n\n## Key Details & Timeline\n\nThe Public Works Committee will review the City Engineer's report on this matter on **Wednesday, May 22, 2024 at 1:30 PM** in Room 401 at City Hall. If the Committee approves an action, the matter will advance to the full City Council for consideration on **Tuesday, June 25, 2024 at 10:00 AM**. The project identification number is VAC-E1401355, and the council file number is 13-0347-S1.\n\n## Who Is Involved\n\nAccording to the mailing list, interested parties include David Evans and Associates (an engineering firm), P.I.G Development LLC, Kane Industrial Properties LLC, and the State Department of Transportation. These organizations likely have properties adjacent to or affected by the alley.\n\n## How to Participate\n\nResidents can attend the meetings in person at City Hall or submit written comments via LACouncilComment.com, fax (213) 978-1079, or mail to the Public Works Committee. Note that in-person public comment is required for the Committee hearing, though the full Council meeting may allow teleconference options.",
