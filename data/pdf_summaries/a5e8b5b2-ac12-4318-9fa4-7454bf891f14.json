  "summary": "# Summary: Tiny Home Village Lease Agreement at 5301 Sierra Vista Avenue\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City of Los Angeles is seeking approval to negotiate and execute a lease agreement with GMA - Sierra Vista, LLC and Sierra Vista-Y, LLC to operate a Tiny Home Village (THV) at 5301 Sierra Vista Avenue in Council District 13. The facility would provide 51 beds of emergency interim housing for people experiencing homelessness and would count toward the City's obligations under the Alliance Settlement Agreement. The Municipal Facilities Committee approved this recommendation on February 27, 2025, with the condition that the lease is contingent on the full execution of a contract with nonprofit Dignity Moves to construct and build the site.\n\n## Why Is This Needed?\n\nThe Tiny Home Village is part of the City's broader strategy to address homelessness through emergency housing. The project has been previously approved by City Council as part of the Third Alliance Funding report, which allocated $3.86 million in Emergency Stabilization Beds Grant funds to support construction of 45 units (51 beds total) using the Boss Cubez tiny home typology. This lease represents the operational component needed to make the housing site functional.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** 5301 Sierra Vista Avenue, Council District 13 (19,185 square feet)\n- **Capacity:** 51 beds in a mix of single and double occupancy units, plus six hygiene cabins, laundry facilities, offices, and community structures\n- **Lease Terms:** 36 months from commencement with two optional one-year extensions; rent begins at $0 for the first 60 days, then escalates from $2,568/month to $31,000/month by February 2026, with 3% annual increases thereafter\n- **Construction Timeline:** Dignity Moves is expected to complete construction by mid-2026\n\n## Impact\n\nThis decision will provide 51 emergency housing beds for unhoused individuals in CD 13. There is no immediate General Fund impact through Fiscal Year 2025-26, but potential future costs beginning in FY 2026-27 to support ongoing lease payments. The facility includes environmental testing requirements and the City retains the right to terminate the lease if soil testing reveals the site is not viable.",
