  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 24-1200-S19\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Neighborhoods and Community Enrichment Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council approve and confirm the Mayor's appointment of Vivian Garcia to the Los Angeles City/County Native American Indian Commission. Garcia would serve a term ending October 7, 2025, filling a vacancy left by Joseph Quintana's departure.\n\n## Background and Rationale\n\nThe committee reviewed the Mayor's appointment recommendation on June 5, 2024, which was originally submitted on May 20, 2024. The appointment aims to fill an open seat on the Native American Indian Commission, which advises the city and county on matters affecting Native American communities in Los Angeles.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Appointee:** Vivian Garcia\n- **Commission:** Los Angeles City/County Native American Indian Commission\n- **Term End Date:** October 7, 2025\n- **Current Board Composition:** 1 male member, 2 female members, and 2 vacant seats\n- **Committee Vote:** Unanimous approval (Hernandez, Lee, and Hutt all voted YES)\n- **Status:** Background check is pending; no financial disclosure statement is required\n\n## Impact\n\nThis appointment would help ensure the Native American Indian Commission has adequate representation to fulfill its advisory role. With Garcia's appointment, the board would have 4 members instead of 3, bringing it closer to full capacity and strengthening its ability to serve Los Angeles's Native American community.",
