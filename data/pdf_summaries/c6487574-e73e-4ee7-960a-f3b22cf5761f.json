  "summary": "# Summary: Resolution Supporting Senate Bill 84 (Niello)\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to support Senate Bill 84 (SB 84), pending legislation at the state level. The recommendation is to include SB 84 in the City's 2025-2026 State Legislative Program. SB 84 would require small businesses with 50 or fewer employees to receive a mandatory 120-day \"notice-and-cure\" period to fix disability access violations before facing penalties or lawsuits.\n\n## Why?\nCalifornia, particularly San Francisco, experienced a dramatic surge in disability access lawsuits filed against small businesses between 2020-2021. The San Francisco District Attorney identified many of these lawsuits as fraudulent and predatory, targeting immigrant-owned businesses with limited English proficiency. These businesses were often pressured into settling for amounts far exceeding repair costs (averaging $14,000), and many closed without improving actual accessibility. SB 84 aims to protect small businesses while ensuring disability access improvements actually occur.\n\n## Key Details\n- SB 84 requires plaintiffs to serve detailed letters specifying all alleged violations before filing suit\n- Small businesses get 120 days to fix violations before facing liability or attorney fees\n- The bill prevents framing disability claims as general discrimination violations\n- Introduced in response to predatory litigation patterns targeting vulnerable business owners\n- The state Senate passed the amended bill on May 23, 2025\n\n## Impact\nThis affects small business owners seeking fair treatment and individuals with disabilities. Supporters argue it prevents frivolous lawsuits while still requiring accessibility improvements. However, disability rights advocates oppose it, arguing it removes their primary enforcement tool and increases barriers to compliance.",
