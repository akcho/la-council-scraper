  "summary": "# Summary: Ilex Avenue Transmission Line Parcels Community Use Study\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Energy and Environment Committee is recommending that the City conduct a comprehensive study of Department of Water and Power (DWP)-owned land parcels along Ilex Avenue in Sun Valley (from Snelling Street to Telfair Avenue) to determine how these underutilized spaces beneath and adjacent to transmission lines could be converted into community assets. The committee has unanimously approved a motion requesting that DWP, working with multiple city departments and the community, assess the feasibility of transforming these parcels into recreational and gathering spaces.\n\n## Why This Matters?\n\nThese parcels currently sit unused beneath high-voltage transmission infrastructure in a residential neighborhood. The motion aims to identify ways to activate these spaces for community benefit while addressing any safety concerns. By involving local stakeholders and assessing feasibility through city departments, the goal is to find practical solutions that could improve neighborhood livability without compromising utility operations or public safety.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe study must be completed within **90 days** and will include: a site assessment evaluating current conditions and safety/liability concerns; a review of allowable uses under DWP policies and zoning regulations; and exploration of specific amenities such as passive/active recreation areas, gathering spaces, a dog park, and shade structures (trees, gazebos, canopies). The committee unanimously approved the measure, and community engagement is a required component of the process.\n\n## Who This Affects\n\nSun Valley residents stand to gain potential new community spaces and recreational opportunities. The study involves multiple city departments (DWP, Recreation and Parks, Bureau of Street Services, Bureau of Engineering) and requires input from local organizations and stakeholders.",
