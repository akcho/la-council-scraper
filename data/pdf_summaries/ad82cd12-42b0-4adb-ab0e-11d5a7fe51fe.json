  "summary": "# Summary: Municipal Solar and Battery Storage Master Plan\n\n## What is Being Proposed\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to approve two main recommendations from the Government Operations and Energy and Environment Committees. First, the Bureau of Engineering and LA Department of Water and Power (LADWP) should prioritize large City parcels, properties, and parking lots for solar panels and energy storage systems in their decarbonization master plan. Second, these agencies should specifically study the feasibility of adding solar and battery storage to LAPD properties, with special emphasis on the Canoga Park Police Station and its parking lot located at 21501 Schoenborn Street.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nLos Angeles has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy (LA100) and has adopted multiple plans to achieve this, including building electrification and electric vehicle rollout strategies. The City owns approximately 1,000 properties that could potentially be used for renewable energy generation and storage. By strategically deploying solar and battery systems on large municipal properties—particularly in hot areas like Canoga Park and the West San Fernando Valley—the City can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower its own energy bills, and maximize renewable energy generation for the power grid.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe Canoga Park Police Station, operational since January 2009, is specifically identified as a priority location due to the region's high temperatures and its large available surface area. The report directs the agencies to consider federal and state incentive programs and to determine the best procurement methods for these projects, such as Net-Energy Metering, Feed-In-Tariff programs, or Municipal Solar and Energy Resiliency projects. Both committees unanimously approved this motion on October 21, 2025.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis initiative will help Los Angeles meet its climate goals while generating energy savings for the City. Residents, particularly those in the San Fernando Valley, will benefit from a more resilient power grid and reduced greenhouse gas emissions in their community. The City will need to invest in feasibility studies and implementation but stands to recover costs through reduced energy bills and potential revenue generation.",
