  "summary": "# Motion Summary: Security Services at Runyon Canyon Park\n\n## What is Being Proposed\nCouncilmember Nithya Raman is proposing to transfer $37,500 from the Council District 4 portion of the Council Projects budget to fund two security officers who will provide evening and late-night security services at Runyon Canyon Park. The security officers would work from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m., and the funds would be transferred from the General City Purposes Fund to the Recreation and Parks Fund.\n\n## Why\nWhile the document doesn't explicitly state the rationale, the proposal addresses public safety concerns at Runyon Canyon Park during evening and late-night hours—times when the popular hiking destination may be vulnerable to crime or safety issues. The funding allows the Department of Recreation and Parks to contract with a security provider (such as Allied Universal Security) to increase protective presence during these hours.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Amount:** $37,500 from District 4's Council Projects budget\n- **Location:** Runyon Canyon Park\n- **Coverage:** 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. daily\n- **Staffing:** Two security officers\n- **Service Provider:** To be contracted with City Attorney approval\n- **Presented by:** Councilmember Nithya Raman (District 4)\n- **Date:** October 24, 2025\n\n## Impact\nThis motion benefits District 4 residents and visitors to Runyon Canyon Park by providing additional security during evening hours, potentially deterring crime and improving public safety. The Recreation and Parks Department is authorized to handle contracting and fund administration details as needed.",
