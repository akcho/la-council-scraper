  "summary": "# Summary: Fourth Amendment to Discovery Cube Los Angeles Partnership\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Energy and Environment Committee is recommending that the City authorize the Board of Public Works to execute Amendment No. 4 to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Discovery Cube Los Angeles (DCLA). This amendment would extend the City's partnership with DCLA to develop, promote, and assist with Bureau of Sanitation (BOS) environmental events and programs, with a total cost ceiling of $1.8 million.\n\n## Funding and Financial Impact\nThe $1.8 million commitment is fully funded through the City's 2025-26 Adopted Budget with no additional burden on the General Fund. Funding comes from three sources: $900,000 from the General City Purposes Fund, $450,000 from BOS's Sewer Operations and Maintenance Fund, and $450,000 from the Solid Waste Resources Revenue Fund. All these funds have already been appropriated.\n\n## Committee Action\nThe Energy and Environment Committee unanimously approved this recommendation on October 21, 2025, with all five committee members voting in favor (Nazarian, Yaroslavsky, Jurado, Raman, and Padilla voting YES). The matter now goes to the full City Council for approval.\n\n## Timeline and Significance\nThis is a time-limited file with a deadline of December 16, 2025 (last council action date: December 12, 2025). The partnership aims to support the Bureau of Sanitation's environmental education and community outreach efforts through Discovery Cube Los Angeles's programming and reach.",
