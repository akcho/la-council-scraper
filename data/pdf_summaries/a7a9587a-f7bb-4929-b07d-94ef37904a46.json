  "summary": "# Summary: City Attorney Report on Parking Citation Late Fee Litigation\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City Attorney's Office is requesting that the Los Angeles City Council hold a closed session to discuss legal strategy regarding an ongoing federal lawsuit challenging the City's $63 late fee on unpaid parking citations. The case, *Jesus Pimentel et al. v. City of Los Angeles*, has been in federal court since 2014 (Case No. CV14-01371-FMO).\n\n## Why?\n\nThe plaintiffs are mounting a constitutional challenge to the City's parking citation late fee structure. The City Attorney needs to meet with the Council in a closed session—permitted under California Government Code Section 54956.9(d)(1)—to discuss litigation strategy, legal advice, and recommendations on how to proceed with this case. This type of sensitive legal discussion is conducted in closed session to protect attorney-client privilege and litigation strategy.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Case name:** *Jesus Pimentel et al. v. City of Los Angeles et al.*\n- **Case number:** USDC CV14-01371-FMO (federal court)\n- **Issue:** Constitutional challenge to the City's $63 late fee for unpaid parking citations\n- **Lead attorneys:** Assistant City Attorney Gabriel S.

The outcome could determine whether the $63 late fee structure can continue or must be modified, potentially impacting city revenue and parking enforcement policies.",
