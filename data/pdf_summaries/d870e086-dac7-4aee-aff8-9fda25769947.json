  "summary": "# Summary: SB 79 Implementation Support Letter\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Housing Action Coalition (HAC) is urging the Los Angeles City Council to fully and faithfully implement Senate Bill 79 (SB 79), a state law that expands transit-oriented development throughout California. The letter supports Council File 25-1083 and encourages the city to approach SB 79 as a major opportunity rather than a problem to manage. HAC specifically asks the city to include all high- and highest-resource neighborhoods—including single-family zones near major transit stops—in SB 79's coverage without broad exemptions or delays.\n\n## Why?\nSB 79 was enacted to address three interconnected goals: increase housing near major bus and rail corridors, reduce carbon emissions, and advance fair housing obligations. The letter expresses concern that the city's motion to study implementation risks treating SB 79 as a threat to mitigate rather than a cornerstone of the city's Housing Element and Climate Action commitments. HAC argues that broad delays or exemptions would perpetuate historic inequities and contradict the law's spirit.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Stakeholder**: Housing Action Coalition, a nonprofit advocating for more housing and equitable growth across California\n- **Author**: Jesse Zwick, Southern California Director\n- **Date**: October 28, 2025\n- **Related Motion**: Councilmember Park introduced the motion triggering this response\n- HAC supports limited, evidence-based exemptions only in low-resource multifamily neighborhoods with genuine displacement risks, paired with robust tenant protections\n\n## Impact\nThis affects all Los Angeles residents by influencing housing supply and affordability near transit. The letter advocates that the city's analysis should quantify benefits including increased housing supply, tax revenues, reduced emissions, improved transit ridership, and progress toward the city's affordable housing obligations (RHNA and AFFH requirements).",
