  "summary": "# Summary: Pacoima Little League Facility Improvements Motion\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\n\nCouncilmember Monica Rodriguez is proposing to transfer $326,177.75 in remaining Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds from a completed Carl Street Gap Closure project to fund additional improvements at the Pacoima Little League facility located at 11000 Dronfield Avenue in Council District 7.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe Carl Street Gap Closure project (funded under a prior budget cycle) was recently completed ahead of schedule. Rather than let the remaining CDBG funds go unused, the motion redirects these funds to benefit the Pacoima Little League—a facility that serves a low-to-moderate income community. The motion also supports the Department of Recreation and Parks' planned construction of shade structures at the site, which was originally allocated funding in the current fiscal year budget.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Amount:** $326,177.75 in remaining CDBG funds\n- **Location:** Pacoima Little League, 11000 Dronfield Avenue, Council District 7\n- **Funding source:** Community Development Trust Fund (remaining from Carl Street Gap Closure project)\n- **Project scope:** Shade structures and additional facility improvements\n- **Authority:** The Community Investment for Families Department (CIFD) is authorized to process documents and execute payments with City Attorney approval\n\n## Impact\n\nThis benefits the local low-to-moderate income community by improving recreational facilities for youth. The reallocation maximizes use of available public funds without requiring new budget allocations.",
