  "summary": "# Summary of Council File 25-1220\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Personnel and Hiring Committee is recommending that the City of Los Angeles develop comprehensive workplace accommodations for employees experiencing menopause. The committee has instructed the Personnel Department to submit a report within 120 days outlining: (1) how leave and benefits policies can be updated to accommodate menopause, including making it explicit in sick leave allowances; (2) mandatory supervisor training options and resource guides for employees; and (3) practical workplace solutions such as desktop fans or lighter-weight uniforms.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nMenopause is a natural and significant life transition affecting a substantial portion of the workforce. The average woman spends 40% of her life in some phase of menopause, with approximately 1.3 million U.S. women entering menopause annually. The condition involves more than 80 recognized physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms that 80% of women experience in some combination. Despite its prevalence, menopause remains highly stigmatized in workplaces—research shows one in three employees conceal their symptoms due to fear of judgment, and one in three have considered reducing their workload because of symptoms.\n\n## Key Details\n\nMid-life employees experiencing menopause represent 20% of the U.S. workforce. Research indicates that two in five menopausal employees either considered leaving their job or actually found new employment due to inadequate workplace support. The committee voted 2-1 in favor (with one absence) on November 5, 2025, recommending approval of the motion.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects approximately 20% of the city's workforce and aims to improve job satisfaction, reduce employee turnover, and enhance overall organizational productivity by creating a more supportive work environment for mid-life women employees.",
