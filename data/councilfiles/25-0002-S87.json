      "summary": "# Summary: Preventing Auto Recycling Theft Act Support\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to support two federal bills—S. 2238 (sponsored by Senator Klobuchar) and H.R. 5221 (sponsored by Representative Baird)—by including them in the City's 2025-26 Federal Legislative Program. These bills would require Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) to be etched onto catalytic converters to help identify and trace stolen parts.\n\n## Why This Matters?\nCatalytic converter theft has become a widespread problem that disproportionately harms lower-income communities and small businesses. The financial burden of replacing stolen converters, combined with vehicle downtime, creates significant hardship for vulnerable populations. Currently, the absence of identifiable markings on catalytic converters makes it extremely difficult for law enforcement to trace stolen parts, prosecute offenders, and help victims recover their losses.\n\n## Key Details\nThe Rules, Elections and Intergovernmental Relations Committee unanimously voted to recommend approval on October 21, 2025, with all five committee members voting yes (Harris-Dawson, Raman, Yaroslavsky, Soto-Martinez, and Lee). The proposal was supported by the Westside Neighborhood Council. The measure requires Mayor approval and is subject to full City Council action.\n\n## Impact\nIf adopted, this position would align Los Angeles with federal efforts to combat auto parts theft and protect residents—especially those in lower-income areas and small business owners—from the growing problem of catalytic converter theft.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Preventing Auto Recycling Theft Act Support Resolution\n\n## What is Being Proposed\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to adopt a resolution expressing the city's official support for two federal bills—S. 2238 and H.R. 5221, known as the Preventing Auto Recycling Theft Act (PART Act). These bills would require Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) to be etched onto catalytic converters on all new vehicles and would establish a grant program to stamp identification numbers on existing vehicles.\n\n## Why This Matters\nCatalytic converter theft has become a widespread national problem. These devices contain precious metals (platinum, rhodium, and palladium) worth up to $1,000 each on the black market, making them theft targets. However, because they have no identifying marks, stolen converters are nearly impossible for law enforcement to trace back to victims' vehicles. The lack of identifiable markings also makes prosecution difficult. Vehicle owners face replacement costs ranging from $1,000 to $3,500, which disproportionately burdens lower-income communities and small businesses.\n\n## Key Details\nThe PART Act would require: (1) VINs stamped on all new vehicle catalytic converters, (2) a federal grant program to retrofit existing vehicles, (3) record-keeping standards for used converter purchases, and (4) federal criminal penalties for converter theft. The Senate bill was introduced July 10, 2025, and the House version was introduced September 9, 2025. Los Angeles has previously supported similar state legislation, including California's SB 55, though federal requirements would be more effective for out-of-state vehicles.\n\n## Impact\nThis resolution allows the city to officially advocate for federal legislation that would help deter theft, improve law enforcement's ability to recover stolen converters, and reduce the financial burden on vehicle owners citywide.",

      "summary": "# Summary: \"Preventing Auto Recycling Theft Act\" Resolution\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles City Council is adopting a resolution to support two federal bills—S. 2238 and H.R. 5221, collectively known as the \"Preventing Auto Recycling Theft Act.\" These bills would require that Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) be etched on all catalytic converters. By passing this resolution, the City is adding its official support to the City's 2025-26 Federal Legislative Program, signaling to Congress that this legislation matters to Los Angeles.\n\n## Why?\nCatalytic converter theft has become a widespread national crime problem. These parts are valuable on the scrap metal market, making them attractive theft targets. Currently, without identifying markings, stolen converters are nearly impossible for law enforcement to trace back to their original vehicles, making it difficult to prosecute thieves or help victims recover losses. The problem disproportionately impacts lower-income communities and small businesses that cannot easily absorb replacement costs and vehicle downtime.\n\n## Key Details\nLos Angeles previously supported California's SB 55 (2022), which requires VIN etching on catalytic converters sold in California. However, the City recognizes that a federal requirement would be more effective because many vehicles in California come from out-of-state and wouldn't be covered by state law alone. The resolution was presented by Councilmember Bob Blumenfield (3rd District) and dated September 26, 2025.\n\n## Impact\nIf passed at the federal level, VIN etching would create a deterrent for thieves, help law enforcement identify stolen parts, and support efforts to dismantle organized theft rings. This directly benefits vehicle owners, small businesses, and law enforcement across the nation.",
