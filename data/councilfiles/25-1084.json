      "summary": "# Summary of Council File 25-1084\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Planning and Land Use Management Committee is recommending approval of a zone change and new development project at three properties in the North Valley: 11144 Lorne Street, 11146-11148 Lorne Street, and 8032 North Fair Avenue. The zone would change from single-family residential (R1-1-CUGU) to a mixed-use residential zone (T)(Q)RD1.5-1-CUGU, allowing construction of a 17-unit apartment building with attached garages to replace three existing single-family homes.\n\n## Why?\nThe project aims to increase housing availability in Los Angeles, including affordable units. Of the 17 units, 2 are designated as affordable housing (1 for extremely low-income households and 1 for very low-income households), with 15 remaining market-rate units. The project has undergone environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and been approved with mitigation measures to address potential impacts.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Project size**: 26,296.6 square feet with 17 total units\n- **Affordable housing**: 2 of 17 units designated as affordable\n- **Applicant**: Sogomon Petrosyan, represented by Oscar Ensafi\n- **Committee vote**: 4-0 in favor (one member absent)\n- **Deadline**: Council must act by December 12, 2025\n- **Important condition**: The \"Q\" qualified zoning expires in 6 years unless substantial development occurs\n\n## Impact\nThis project will increase residential density in the area and add two permanently affordable units to the city's housing stock. The environmental review found no significant environmental impacts with mitigation measures in place. The development will replace single-family homes with apartments, representing a shift toward denser housing in this neighborhood.",

The document transmits a Letter to Council along with environmental documentation to support the proposed action.\n\n## Environmental Review\n\nThe project has been evaluated under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) using a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND), case number ENV-2019-3203-MND. This indicates that while the project may have some environmental impacts, those impacts can be mitigated to acceptable levels through specific conditions and requirements.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Planner Contact:** Dang Nguyen, (818) 374-5027\n- **Transmittal Date:** October 23, 2025\n- **Procedural Status:** Subject to Chapter 1 regulations as of January 21, 2024\n- **Transmitted By:** Ricardo Vazquez\n\n## What Residents Should Know\n\nWhile this transmittal form itself doesn't detail the specific proposal, it appears the City Planning Department is moving forward with a recommendation to the City Council regarding land use changes for these San Fernando Valley properties. The inclusion of a Letter to Council suggests the recommendation and rationale will be explained directly to council members for their consideration and potential action.",

The proposed change would rezone the property from R1-1-CUGU (single-family residential) to (T)(Q)RD1.5-1-CUGU (a more flexible residential zone). The North Valley Area Planning Commission unanimously approved this recommendation on June 5, 2025, by a vote of 4-0.\n\n## Why This Matters?\nThe zoning change would allow for different residential development on the property. The \"(T)\" and \"(Q)\" designations indicate conditional restrictions and qualifications that would apply to the site. This transmittal is formally sending the Planning Commission's recommendation to the City Council for final consideration and legislative action, including preparation of a draft ordinance by the City Attorney.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Applicant:** Sogomon Petrosyan, represented by Oscar Ensafi\n- **Case Numbers:** APCNV-2019-3202-ZCJ (Planning) and ENV-2019-3203-MND (Environmental)\n- **Environmental Review:** A Mitigated Negative Declaration was prepared, meaning no significant environmental impacts are anticipated with mitigation measures\n- **Commission Vote:** Unanimous 4-0 approval on June 5, 2025\n- **Last Day to Appeal:** September 1, 2025 (no appeals were filed)\n\n## Who This Affects\nResidents and property owners in the surrounding area may be affected by changes to the site's development potential. The City Council must now formally act on this recommendation through an ordinance before the zoning change becomes official.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Zone Change for 11146-11148 Lorne Street, Sun Valley\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe North Valley Area Planning Commission is recommending that the City Council approve a zone change for a property at 11146-11148 Lorne Street in Sun Valley from R1-1-CUGU (single-family residential) to (T)(Q)RD1.5-1-CUGU (multi-family residential with temporary and qualified restrictions). The project involves demolishing three existing single-family homes to construct a 17-unit apartment building with attached garages. Of the 17 units, two will be affordable housing (one extremely low income, one very low income), while 15 will be market-rate.\n\n## Why?\nThe city supports this project to increase housing supply in alignment with Los Angeles's Green New Deal goals to construct 100,000 new housing units by 2021 and locate new housing near transit. The site is underutilized and located approximately 0.4 miles from the Sun Valley Metrolink Station and multiple bus lines. The proposed zoning is consistent with the Sun Valley–La Tuna Canyon Community Plan's Low Medium II Residential designation. The project would represent a net increase of 14 residential units at the location.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** 11146–11148 Lorne Street, Sun Valley (Council District 6)\n- **Current/Proposed Zone:** R1-1-CUGU → (T)(Q)RD1.5-1-CUGU\n- **Project Size:** 26,296.6 square feet; 17 total units\n- **Commission Vote:** 4-0 approval (June 5, 2025)\n- **Environmental Review:** Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) adopted\n- **Appeal Deadline:** September 1, 2025\n\n## Impact\nThe zone change enables redevelopment of an underutilized residential lot to increase housing supply and affordability in Sun Valley. Residents will benefit from improved pedestrian infrastructure, street lighting, and transit access. The project includes numerous conditions requiring affordable housing covenants, labor protections (prevailing wages, local hiring requirements), design compliance with citywide guidelines, and street improvements along Lorne Street and Fair Avenue.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Tentative Classification Removal Conditions\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThis document outlines the conditions required to remove a \"(T) Tentative Classification\" from a property in Los Angeles (identified as APCNV-2019-3202-ZCJ). A tentative classification restricts development until specific public improvements and dedications are completed. Once these conditions are met through final map recordation or City Engineer guarantees, the restriction can be lifted and development can proceed.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe tentative classification exists to ensure that new development contributes necessary public infrastructure improvements. Before buildings can be constructed on or near this property, the city requires guarantees that improvements to neighboring streets, utilities, and public spaces will be completed to standards. This protects both the public and future property owners by ensuring adequate infrastructure.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe property fronts **Fair Avenue and Lorne Street**. Required improvements include:\n- **Dedication**: A 3-foot strip of land on Fair Avenue to complete a 33-foot half right-of-way\n- **Street improvements**: New concrete sidewalks, curb/gutter repair, and ADA-compliant driveways on both streets\n- **Street trees**: Installation of new street trees with root barriers\n- **Street lighting**: One new streetlight on Lorne Street\n- **Fire access**: Proper fire lanes, hydrants, and Knox Boxes for Fire Department access\n- Coordination with multiple city agencies (Bureau of Engineering, Urban Forestry, Fire Department, Department of Transportation)\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects the property owner/developer, who must complete or guarantee these improvements before building permits are issued. For nearby residents and users, these conditions ensure the streets will have improved sidewalks, safety features, and pedestrian infrastructure. The conditions primarily impact the immediate area around Fair Avenue and Lorne Street where construction will occur.",

This will allow the demolition of 3 existing single-family homes and construction of a new 17-unit apartment complex with attached garages on approximately 26,300 square feet of land.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe project supports multiple city goals, including Mayor Garcetti's LA Green New Deal to increase housing production (100,000 new units by 2021) and locate housing near transit. The current zoning is inconsistent with the Sun Valley-La Tuna Canyon Community Plan's Low Medium II Residential designation. The proposed development increases the city's housing supply, provides a net gain of 14 units, and supports neighborhood transit-oriented development.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** Sun Valley area, approximately 0.4 miles from Sun Valley Metrolink Station and near San Fernando Road/Sunland Boulevard intersection\n- **Transit Access:** Close to Metro bus lines 90, 169, and 294; near elementary school (Arminta Elementary)\n- **Project Scale:** 17 new residential units replacing 3 homes\n- **Conditions:** Project includes street improvements (sidewalks, curb/gutter repairs), land dedication for Fair Avenue, ADA-compliant driveway, and compliance with green building standards\n- **Environmental Review:** Mitigated Negative Declaration approved with mitigation measures\n\n## Impact\n\nResidents in the area will see increased housing density in a transitional zone between single-family neighborhoods and multi-family/commercial developments. The project benefits the broader city by increasing housing options near public transit, supporting affordability goals, and requiring infrastructure improvements (better pedestrian access, street repairs) that benefit the community.",

      "summary": "# Summary of Council File 25-1084\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Planning and Land Use Management (PLUM) Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council approve a zone change and new housing development at three properties in the North Valley area: 11144 Lorne Street, 11146-11148 Lorne Street, and 8032 North Fair Avenue. The rezoning would change the properties from single-family residential (R1-1-CUGU) to a mixed-use residential zone (T)(Q)RD1.5-1-CUGU), enabling the demolition of three existing single-family homes and their replacement with a 17-unit apartment complex with attached garages on the approximately 26,300 square foot lot.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe project advances the City's housing goals by creating new residential units, including two permanently affordable units (one for extremely low-income households and one for very low-income households) alongside 15 market-rate units. The Committee determined that with required mitigation measures, the project will have no substantial environmental impact. The project was reviewed and approved by the North Valley Area Planning Commission and is now ready for full City Council consideration.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Project**: 17-unit apartment complex replacing 3 single-family homes\n- **Affordable Housing**: 2 units (11.8% of total units)\n- **Applicant**: Sogomon Petrosyan (Oscar Ensafi, representative)\n- **Environmental Review**: Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) with mitigation measures\n- **Deadline**: Council must act by December 12, 2025\n- **Fiscal Impact**: No General Fund impact; administrative costs recovered through fees\n\n## Impact\n\nThis project adds housing capacity to the North Valley neighborhood and contributes to the City's affordable housing supply. The zone change requires substantial development within six years or the approval expires. Residents in the area may experience temporary construction impacts, though these are deemed mitigable through conditions of approval.",

The transmittal includes a Letter to Council and indicates that a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) environmental document has been prepared for the project.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe document is being transmitted to the City Clerk's office on October 23, 2025, by Ricardo Vazquez from the Planning Department. The planner of record is Dang Nguyen. The case involves three separate parcels on Lorne Street and one on Fair Avenue. The procedural regulations note that this case follows Chapter 1 guidelines as of January 21, 2024, and is not subject to the Processes & Procedures Ordinance.\n\n## What This Means\n\nThis transmittal is a procedural step that moves the zoning case forward in the approval process. The inclusion of an environmental assessment (MND) suggests the project has been reviewed for potential environmental impacts and found to have minimal negative effects, either with mitigation measures in place or as proposed. The fact that this is marked \"Supplemental\" indicates this is an updated or additional submission to the City Council, likely clarifying or adding information to a previous filing.\n\n**For Residents:** If you live in or near this area, this project may affect zoning, land use, or development at these four properties, and it is now being formally reviewed by the City Council.",

The original determination letter identified the project as being located at \"11146-11148 Lorne Street,\" but the correction seeks to formally include three addresses: **11144 Lorne Street, 11146-11148 Lorne Street, and 8032 N Fair Avenue**. The underlying project itself—a zone change from R1-1 to (T)(Q)RD1.5-1-CUGU to allow construction of a 17-unit apartment building—has already been approved and no appeals were filed.\n\n## Why This Correction is Necessary\n\nThe correction addresses two address omissions from the August 2025 determination letter. The address **8032 N Fair Avenue was inadvertently left out** despite being properly noticed in the original hearing and shown on all project plans and zone change maps. Additionally, **11144 Lorne Street**, while not officially recognized by the Bureau of Engineering, was raised during the public hearing by a resident who claimed not to have received proper notice. The Planning Department confirmed that this address is subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance according to the Housing and Community Investment Department, making it part of the actual project site.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Project Case Number:** APCNV-2019-3202-ZCJ\n- **Location:** Sun Valley-La Tuna Canyon Community Plan area, Los Angeles (ZIP 91352)\n- **Project Type:** Demolition and construction of 17-unit apartment complex\n- **Original Determination Date:** August 11, 2025\n- **Correction Request Date:** October 3, 2025 (supplemental transmittal); formally submitted October 22, 2025\n\n## Impact\n\nThis correction ensures **full transparency and proper legal documentation** for residents and property owners at all affected addresses, particularly protecting rent-stabilized tenants at 11144 Lorne Street who may have housing rights under Los Angeles ordinances.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Zone Change for 11146-11148 Lorne Street, Sun Valley\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\n\nThe North Valley Area Planning Commission is recommending that the City Council approve a zone change for a property at 11146-11148 Lorne Street in Sun Valley from R1-1-CUGU (single-family residential) to (T)(Q)RD1.5-1-CUGU (low-medium density multi-family residential). This would allow the demolition of three existing single-family homes and construction of a new 17-unit apartment building with attached garages on the approximately 26,300 square-foot lot. The project includes two affordable units (one for extremely low-income households and one for very low-income households) and 15 market-rate units.\n\n## Why Is This Needed?\n\nThe zone change addresses several city planning goals. The current zoning is inconsistent with the Sun Valley-La Tuna Canyon Community Plan, which designates this area for \"Low Medium II Residential\" land use. The project supports Mayor Garcetti's housing goals by increasing the city's housing supply near transit—the site is located 0.4 miles from the Sun Valley Metrolink Station and near multiple Metro bus lines. The proposal also brings the property into compliance with the General Plan and improves pedestrian infrastructure through required street improvements.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe Planning Commission voted 4-0 in favor on June 5, 2025. The project includes significant conditions: street improvements on both Lorne Street and Fair Avenue (including new sidewalks and ADA-compliant driveways), a 3-foot land dedication along Fair Avenue, prevailing wage requirements for construction workers, design guidelines compliance, and housing affordability covenants for 55 years. The environmental review (Mitigated Negative Declaration) found no significant adverse impacts with mitigation measures in place.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change affects residents and potential future residents of the Sun Valley area. It increases local housing options but replaces three single-family homes with a multi-family building, altering neighborhood character. New residents and workers will benefit from proximity to transit and services. The project requires compliance with numerous conditions protecting neighboring properties, including design standards, landscaping, and traffic management measures.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Zoning Change Ordinance for Sun Valley Property\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe ordinance amends the zoning map to reclassify a property in Sun Valley from its current zone to **(T)(Q)RD1.5-1-CUGU**, which permits residential development with qualified restrictions. The property is located on Fair Avenue and Lorne Street and comprises approximately 0.35 acres. This zoning change allows the development of a multifamily residential project on the site.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe zoning change is being pursued to enable housing development on an underutilized property. The \"Q\" (Qualified) designation indicates the City has imposed specific conditions to ensure the project aligns with community goals, including affordable housing requirements, design standards, and labor protections. The North Valley Area Planning Commission recommended adoption of this ordinance on June 5, 2025.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe project is limited to **17 dwelling units maximum**. Critical conditions include: (1) a minimum of 5% of units affordable to Extremely Low Income households and either 6% for Very Low Income or 15% for Lower Income households for 55 years; (2) one unit reserved for Extremely Low Income and one for Very Low Income households; (3) construction labor requirements including 30% local hiring and prevailing wages; (4) comprehensive design guidelines addressing pedestrian safety, energy efficiency, landscaping, and stormwater management; and (5) mechanical equipment screening and outdoor lighting restrictions.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis ordinance affects the property owner/developer and future Sun Valley residents. It generates approximately 17 new housing units while requiring a significant portion (11-16 units) to remain affordable long-term. The project must comply with strict design, environmental, and labor standards. Neighboring residents may experience construction impacts, though design conditions aim to minimize negative effects on the surrounding neighborhood character.",

The Tentative Classification is a planning designation that prevents certain development activities until specific public improvements and dedications are completed. Removal of this classification allows the project to proceed with building permits and development.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe Tentative Classification was placed on the property to ensure that necessary public infrastructure improvements are made before development occurs. This protects the community by requiring developers to address street conditions, utilities, fire safety, and other public needs as part of their project. The conditions outlined here detail exactly what the applicant/developer must complete or guarantee before the classification can be removed.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe property is located at the intersection of **Lorne Street and Fair Avenue**. Major requirements include:\n\n- **Dedication**: A 3-foot strip of land along Fair Avenue to complete a 33-foot half right-of-way\n- **Street improvements**: New sidewalks, curb/gutter repairs, ADA-compliant driveways, and new street lighting on both streets\n- **Urban forestry**: Preservation of healthy mature trees with potential 2:1 replacement if removal is necessary\n- **Fire safety**: Knox Boxes, proper access roads (minimum 20-28 feet wide), fire hydrants, and specific building design standards\n- **Drainage and sewers**: Proper site drainage and potential extension of sewer connections\n\nMultiple city departments oversee compliance, including the Bureau of Engineering, Fire Department, Urban Forestry Division, and Bureau of Street Lighting.\n\n## Impact\n\nThese conditions affect the **developer/applicant**, who must guarantee completion of all improvements before building permits are issued. **Residents** benefit from improved streets, sidewalks, safety infrastructure, and tree preservation. The process ensures public infrastructure is upgraded in conjunction with private development, at no cost to the City.",

The site is located 0.4 miles from the Sun Valley Metrolink Station and near multiple Metro bus lines, making it suitable for higher-density residential development.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe project site is located near San Fernando Road and Sunland Boulevard in Sun Valley, an area with existing commercial services, schools, and public transportation. The proposal includes requirements for street improvements (sidewalks, curbs, and gutter repairs on Lorne Street and Fair Avenue), dedication of land to complete collector street standards, and compliance with the City's Clean Up Green Up (CUGU) Ordinance. Environmental review determined no significant environmental impacts with imposed mitigation measures.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis development would increase housing opportunities in the area while promoting transit-oriented development. The project is designed to transition between the surrounding single-family neighborhoods and multi-family/commercial developments. Residents will gain closer proximity to transit, services, and employment centers, potentially reducing vehicle trips.

      "summary": "# Summary: Environmental Analysis for Lorne Street Development Project\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City is evaluating a residential development project at 11146-11148 Lorne Street in Sun Valley that would demolish three existing single-family homes and replace them with a 17-unit apartment building with attached garages. The project also requires a zoning change from R1-1 (single-family residential) to (T)(Q)RD1.5-1 (multi-family residential). This Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration represents the environmental review required under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).\n\n## Why?\nThe property owner, Sogomon Petrosyan, has proposed this higher-density residential development to maximize housing on the site. The zoning change is necessary to allow the increased density (approximately one unit per 1,500 square feet). The environmental review is required by law to identify and mitigate any potential impacts before the city can approve the project.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** 11146-11148 Lorne Street, Sun Valley (26,297 square feet total)\n- **Project Size:** 26,740 square feet of floor area across three buildings\n- **Heights:** Buildings range from 35 to 37 feet\n- **Parking:** 33 on-site spaces\n- **Population Change:** Net addition of 14 dwelling units (from 3 existing to 17 proposed)\n- **Environmental Finding:** The document concludes that with mitigation measures, the project will have \"less than significant\" impacts\n\n## Impact\nThis project would increase housing supply in the area by 14 units while affecting three existing households. The environmental analysis determined that potential impacts to air quality, noise, traffic, cultural resources, and tribal cultural resources can be mitigated to acceptable levels through standard construction practices, building code compliance, and specific mitigation measures. Residents and neighboring properties would experience temporary construction impacts and increased traffic/density upon completion.",
