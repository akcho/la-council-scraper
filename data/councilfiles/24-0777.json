      "summary": "# Summary: Council File 24-0777 - Marketing Specialist Classification Restoration\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Personnel and Hiring Committee recommends that the Los Angeles City Council adopt an ordinance to restore the \"Marketing Specialist\" job classification (Class Code 1807) to the City's official list of civilian positions in the Los Angeles Administrative Code. This is a non-represented (non-union) position that the City accidentally removed from its records.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe Marketing Specialist classification was originally established by the City Council on August 12, 2008, through Ordinance No. 180119, with an effective date of January 1, 2007. However, when the City updated its official classification list in subsequent ordinances, this position was inadvertently omitted. Most recently, the position was missing from Ordinance No. 188307, adopted in July 2024. This ordinance corrects that administrative error by formally restoring the classification.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Class Code:** 1807\n- **Type:** Non-represented (non-union) position\n- **Originally Established:** August 12, 2008\n- **Fiscal Impact:** None — hiring costs will be absorbed within existing 2025-26 budget funds\n- **Committee Vote:** 2 YES votes (McOsker, Rodriguez), 1 Absent (Soto-Martinez)\n- **Date Approved:** October 24, 2025\n\n## Impact\n\nThis restoration allows the City to officially hire or employ people in the Marketing Specialist role without legal ambiguity. Since there is no fiscal impact and costs fit within existing budgets, this primarily affects administrative clarity and the ability of city departments to staff this position appropriately.",

      "summary": "# Summary of Los Angeles City Council Ordinance No. 188655\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\n\nOrdinance No. 188655 freezes and reduces salary increases for non-represented (non-union) employees in the Office of the Mayor and City Council offices. Specifically, it removes three previously-scheduled salary increases (June 29, 2025; December 28, 2025; and June 28, 2026) and provides adjusted lower salary ranges for subsequent pay adjustment dates through July 1, 2028.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe ordinance appears to be a fiscal measure to control city spending by canceling planned salary increases for executive and administrative staff in City Hall. This represents a reversal of salary growth that was previously authorized under Ordinance No. 188307. The document does not explicitly state the reason, but this typically reflects budget constraints or fiscal priorities.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe salary freeze affects approximately 18 job classifications, including the Chief of Staff to the Mayor, Deputy Mayor, and seven levels of Council Aides and Mayoral Aides. The changes take effect on different dates between June 29, 2025, and July 1, 2028. For example, Council Aide I salaries are reduced from a previously scheduled range, and similar adjustments apply across all affected positions.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects approximately 100+ non-represented City Hall staff members who will receive no salary increases during the freeze period and face lower salary ranges in future years. While executive-level positions (Chief of Staff, Deputy Mayor) see minimal changes, lower-level administrative staff experience more significant reductions relative to their salaries. The ordinance was passed by the Council on June 24, 2025, and became effective June 27, 2025.",

Specifically, the ordinances would remove a 4% salary increase scheduled for June 29, 2025, for Council Aide positions and eliminate multiple salary increases scheduled for June 29, 2025, December 28, 2025, and June 28, 2026, for Mayor's office positions including the Chief of Staff, Deputy Mayor, and Mayoral Aides.\n\n## Why This Action\n\nThe City Council adopted a motion on May 28, 2025, directing this action, and the Mayor also requested similar salary reductions for his office staff. The primary reason is fiscal—the city is seeking to reduce budget expenditures during a period of financial constraints.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe salary cancellations affect approximately 8-15 non-union positions across both offices. While the June 2025 salary increases will be removed, other previously scheduled salary dates will remain in effect but adjusted downward based on the revised salary figures. The ordinances amend both the Los Angeles Administrative Code Section 4.61 Schedule \"A\" and the 2024-25 Departmental Personnel Ordinance for the City Council.\n\n## Financial Impact\n\nThe city estimates these salary reductions will save the General Fund approximately $3 million in FY2025-26, $4.5 million in FY2026-27, and $4.8 million in FY2027-28.

The correction changes the union designation from MOU 12 to MOU 65 for both class codes (1967-1 and 1967-2).\n\n## Why This Correction is Needed\nWhen the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 188307 on July 2, 2024, the Senior Park Ranger positions were mistakenly assigned to MOU 12 instead of the correct union designation, MOU 65. This administrative error needs to be corrected to ensure proper union representation for these city employees.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Original Ordinance:** No. 188307 (C.F. 24-0777), adopted July 2, 2024, effective July 20, 2024\n- **Positions Affected:** Senior Park Ranger I (Class Code 1967-1) and Senior Park Ranger II (Class Code 1967-2)\n- **Correction Period:** Retroactively applied from June 30, 2024 through July 1, 2028\n- **Sent to:** Kenneth Mejia, Controller, for implementation\n\n## Impact\nThis correction ensures that Senior Park Rangers are properly represented by the correct union (MOU 65) and helps resolve any administrative or payroll issues that may have resulted from the initial misclassification. The change is retroactive, meaning it corrects records back to June 30, 2024.",

It provides a comprehensive pay schedule for over 300 job classifications, including administrative staff, technicians, analysts, and various support positions. The document shows regular salary increases scheduled on specific dates throughout this period.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe salary schedule ensures competitive compensation for city workers who are not part of a union bargaining unit. Regular scheduled increases help with employee retention, cost-of-living adjustments, and maintain the city's ability to recruit qualified staff for critical positions across multiple departments and agencies.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Timeframe**: Eight pay periods from June 30, 2024, to July 1, 2028\n- **Salary Increases**: Generally occur every six months, with increases typically ranging from 2-5% per adjustment\n- **Job Classifications**: Covers positions from entry-level trainees (starting around $17-23/hour or ~$1,600-2,500 monthly) to executive-level roles (reaching $11,000-13,000+ monthly)\n- **Notable Positions**: Includes Executive Director roles, Chiefs, Analysts, and specialized technical positions across city departments\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects hundreds of non-union city employees' paychecks and budgeting. Residents indirectly bear the cost through city budget allocations, while affected employees receive clarity on their compensation trajectory. The schedule helps ensure the city can retain experienced staff in administrative, technical, and professional roles essential to city services.",

      "summary": "# Summary: 2024-2029 Salary Schedule for Non-Represented City Employees\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThis document presents a revised salary schedule for Los Angeles City non-represented employees (those not covered by union contracts) covering the period from June 30, 2024, through July 1, 2028. The schedule outlines salary ranges and amounts for approximately 300+ job classifications, with scheduled increases occurring on specific dates throughout this period.\n\n## Why?\n\nNon-represented employees require periodic salary adjustments to remain competitive with market rates, ensure fiscal sustainability, and maintain employee retention. This revised schedule supersedes the previous version and reflects updated compensation levels across eight distinct pay periods over the four-year span.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe salary schedule includes eight adjustment dates: June 30, 2024; December 29, 2024; June 29, 2025; December 28, 2025; June 28, 2026; December 27, 2026; June 27, 2027; and December 26, 2027/July 1, 2028. Salaries are presented as either monthly amounts or hourly rates, depending on position type. For example, an Academy Trainee (Code 2208) increases from $23.22/hour on June 30, 2024, to $27.71/hour by July 1, 2028. Higher-level positions like the Executive Director of Public Accountability increase from $11,392 to $13,606 monthly over the same period.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects all approximately 300+ non-represented City employees across various departments, including administrative, technical, managerial, and professional roles. The scheduled increases provide predictable salary growth over the four-year period, potentially improving employee morale and retention while requiring corresponding budgetary allocations for the City's personnel costs.",

      "summary": "# Summary: General Manager Salary Schedule for Los Angeles City\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThis document establishes biweekly salary ranges for Los Angeles City General Managers and related executive positions across multiple departments, effective through July 1, 2028. The 2nd Revision updates the salary schedule with specific dollar amounts for each position at nine different effective dates, with the final amounts becoming effective December 26, 2027, and remaining unchanged through July 1, 2028.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe salary schedule implements a series of planned cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to keep city executive compensation competitive and attract qualified leadership. The schedule reflects increases of 4% (June 2024), 2% (December 2024), 4% (June 2025), 2% (December 2025), 4% (June 2026), 2% (December 2026), 2% (June 2027), 2% (December 2027), and 0% (July 2028). These adjustments help maintain salary purchasing power and ensure the city can retain experienced managers.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe schedule covers positions ranging from M-13 (highest) to M-7 (lowest) salary ranges, including the Chief Legislative Analyst ($23,220 biweekly by 2028), Fire Chief ($19,929.60), City Engineer ($17,404), and various department managers. Some positions—including General Manager positions at Airports, Water and Power, Harbor Department, Police, and others—show asterisks indicating \"Salary pending Board/Commission action,\" meaning those specific amounts require separate approval.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects approximately 40+ executive positions across the city government. City employees in these roles will receive predictable salary increases over the next three years, though residents will see these costs reflected in city budgets. The document enables the Mayor and relevant Boards/Commissions to set competitive salaries within established ranges under LA Charter Section 508.",

This document establishes biweekly compensation rates for approximately 40 General Manager and executive director positions across various city departments, with scheduled salary increases spanning from June 2024 through July 2028.\n\n## Why?\nThe salary adjustments are designed to provide predictable, phased compensation increases for city leadership positions. The schedule reflects a structured approach to salary growth over approximately four years, with increases timed to occur twice annually (typically in June and December). This framework helps attract and retain qualified executives to lead major city departments and agencies.\n\n## Key Details\nThe salary increases follow this pattern: 4% (June 30, 2024), 2% (December 29, 2024), 4% (June 29, 2025), 2% (December 28, 2025), 4% (June 28, 2026), 2% (December 27, 2026), 2% (June 27, 2027), 2% (December 26, 2027), and 0% (July 1, 2028). Positions are classified into salary ranges (M-7 through M-13), with higher-level positions like the City Administrative Officer, Fire Chief, and City Engineer receiving salaries ranging from approximately $14,000 to $23,000 biweekly by 2028. Some positions remain marked with asterisks, indicating they are subject to separate determination by the Mayor or appropriate Board/Commission.\n\n## Impact\nThis proposal affects approximately 40 senior city managers and executive directors across departments including Police, Fire, Planning, Transportation, Housing, Recreation and Parks, and numerous other city agencies. The salary schedule provides transparency and consistency in executive compensation while potentially increasing annual city payroll costs for these positions due to the cumulative percentage increases over the four-year period.",

The proposed salary increases follow a schedule of 4% increases twice per year in 2024-2026, then 2% increases in 2027, with no increase in 2028.\n\n## Why?\nThe proposal is based on City Council instructions issued on April 17, 2024. The salary adjustments are designed to maintain competitive compensation for non-union city employees and management positions. The ordinance also reflects recent changes to the city's position classifications and the addition of a new Educational Presenters Unit (MOU No. 66).\n\n## Key Details\n- **Salary increases**: 4% (June 30, 2024), 2% (Dec. 29, 2024), 4% (June 29, 2025), 2% (Dec. 28, 2025), 4% (June 28, 2026), 2% (Dec. 27, 2026), 2% (June 27, 2027), 2% (Dec. 26, 2027), and 0% (July 1, 2028)\n- **Total cost**: $24.11 million annually by 2024-25, accumulating to $81.56 million over the five-year period\n- **General Managers**: Same salary increases apply to General Manager positions and their salary ranges\n- **Effective dates**: All salary adjustments begin June 30, 2024\n\n## Impact\nThis affects hundreds of non-represented city classifications across all departments, including administrative staff, analysts, engineers, and General Managers. While employees receive raises that keep pace with inflation and market conditions, the city's General Fund bears the cumulative cost of $81.56 million through fiscal year 2028-29.",
