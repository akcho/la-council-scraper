      "summary": "# Summary: EPA Brownfields Community-Wide Assessment Grant\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to authorize the Bureau of Sanitation to accept and manage a grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for a Brownfields Community-Wide Assessment (CWA) Grant. Specifically, the Council would authorize the Director and General Manager of the Bureau of Sanitation to negotiate, execute agreements, submit applications, and handle all related documents necessary to secure and receive these federal grant funds.\n\n## Why This Matters?\n\nBrownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties contaminated by pollutants, hazardous substances, or petroleum products. A Community-Wide Assessment Grant helps cities identify and evaluate these sites to understand the scope of contamination and plan appropriate remediation. This grant enables Los Angeles to conduct comprehensive assessments of contaminated properties in the city, which is a critical first step toward environmental cleanup and community revitalization.\n\n## Key Details\n\nBoth the Energy and Environment Committee (meeting October 7, 2025) and the Budget and Finance Committee (meeting October 21, 2025) voted unanimously to approve this measure. Notably, there is **no impact to the City's General Fund**, meaning this grant is fully funded by federal dollars. The City Attorney must approve all documents as to form before execution.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis grant will benefit Los Angeles residents by identifying contaminated properties that pose environmental and health risks. It supports the city's ability to address pollution legacies, protect public health, and potentially enable future redevelopment of brownfield sites into productive community assets without using local taxpayer dollars.",

The Council is also asked to adopt an accompanying resolution authorizing acceptance of this grant funding.\n\n## Why?\n\nBrownfields are contaminated or potentially contaminated properties whose redevelopment or reuse is complicated by the presence of hazardous substances, pollutants, or petroleum products. The Los Angeles Sanitation and Environment (LASAN) Brownfields Program has successfully secured over $12 million in grant funding over past years, which has attracted additional public and private development investments. This new grant will support environmental assessment and cleanup activities in communities with environmental justice concerns, helping revitalize underutilized properties and support community development.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe EPA is providing up to $500,000 in grant funding at no cost to the City (no required matching funds or cost-share). The grant period spans four years, starting in October 2025 and ending October 2029. Funds will support Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments, community engagement, site inventories, cleanup planning, and reuse planning for brownfield sites in disadvantaged communities. There is no fiscal impact to the City's General Fund, as grant proceeds will be deposited into a dedicated fund for solid waste management.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis grant benefits Los Angeles residents in low-income and historically underserved communities by enabling environmental remediation and property revitalization without burdening City finances. It supports job creation through cleanup and redevelopment activities, reduces health risks from contaminated sites, and promotes equitable economic development in disadvantaged neighborhoods.",
