      "summary": "# Summary: Contract Amendment for Airport Maintenance Supplies\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\nThe Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council approve a contract amendment with Vista Paint Corporation to continue supplying retroreflective glass beads (reflective materials used on airport runways and taxiways) for Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA). The amendment would increase the contract value by $1.86 million and extend the agreement for two additional years.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Contract:** First Amendment to Contract DA-5640 with Vista Paint Corporation\n- **Financial Impact:** Total contract value increases from $2.79 million to $4.65 million\n- **Duration:** Contract extends two years, from May 30, 2026 to May 29, 2028 (115 months total)\n- **Funding Source:** LAWA's Cost Center for Airside Maintenance & Repair; no impact on the city's General Fund\n- **Committee Vote:** Unanimous approval (Park, McOsker, and Rodriguez all voted YES on October 14, 2025)\n\n## Why This Matters\nRetroreflective glass beads are essential safety materials that help pilots see runway markings during low-visibility conditions. This amendment ensures LAWA can maintain continuous supply of this critical safety material without service interruption. The City Attorney has approved the contract language, and the Board of Airport Commissioners determined this action does not require environmental review under CEQA.",

      "summary": "# Summary: First Amendment to Vista Paint Corporation Contract (DA-5640)\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Board of Airport Commissioners is requesting City Council approval to extend and expand an existing contract with Vista Paint Corporation for the supply and delivery of retro-reflective glass beads used at Los Angeles World Airports. The amendment would extend the contract term through May 29, 2028, and increase the contract value by $1,860,000.\n\n## Key Details\nThe contract amendment will raise the total contract authority from $2,790,000 to $4,650,000. The original contract (DA-5640) involves supplying retro-reflective glass beads—materials used for safety marking and visibility purposes at airport facilities. The Board of Airport Commissioners approved this action on August 21, 2025, through Resolution 28222. There is no impact to the city's General Fund, meaning the cost will be covered through airport operations funding.\n\n## City Council Recommendations\nThe Council is being asked to: (1) approve the contract amendment; (2) concur that the amendment is exempt from California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requirements; and (3) authorize the Los Angeles World Airports CEO or designee to execute the amendment on the city's behalf.\n\n## Impact\nThis contract supports ongoing airport operations and safety infrastructure maintenance. The three-year extension ensures continuity of supply for critical airport safety materials without disrupting services to Los Angeles World Airports.",
