This motion was originally brought forward by Council Members McOsker and Lee.\n\n## Why?\nThe street closure is being extended for **reasons of public safety**, though the specific safety concerns are not detailed in this committee report. The document indicates this is a temporary closure that was already in place and is now being considered for a longer extension.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** 121st Street between Figueroa Street and Hoover Street\n- **Extension Duration:** 18 months\n- **Committee Vote:** The Public Works Committee voted on October 22, 2025, with members Hernandez and Hutt voting YES, member Padilla absent, and one vote noted as \"ME\" (unclear)\n- **Fiscal Impact:** No financial analysis has been completed yet\n- **Community Input:** No community impact statement was submitted\n\n## Impact\nThis decision primarily affects residents and businesses in the affected area of 121st Street, as the closure will continue to restrict vehicle access to that corridor. The next step requires City Council approval before the extension can be implemented.",

The closure will be gated approximately 180 feet west of Figueroa Street, meaning the street will remain open and accessible for pedestrians and vehicular traffic from Hoover Street to the gate location, but will be fully closed beyond that point.\n\n## Why?\nThe Police Department recommended this temporary closure due to serious and continual criminal activities occurring in the alley. The Council determined that closing this street segment will help reduce criminal activities in the area while not substantially disrupting traffic flow, emergency vehicle operations, or municipal services in the surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** 121st Street between Figueroa Street and Hoover Street\n- **Duration:** Maximum 18 months from the resolution's adoption (December 9, 2022)\n- **Partial Access:** The street will remain open and accessible for pedestrians and vehicles up to approximately 180 feet west of Figueroa Street\n- **Authority:** This action is authorized under California State Vehicle Code Section 21101.4\n\n## Impact\nThis closure primarily affects residents and businesses in the immediate area who use 121st Street between Figueroa and Hoover. The partial closure is designed to minimize traffic disruptions while addressing public safety concerns specific to that alley segment.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Temporary Closure of 121st Street\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Engineer recommends temporarily closing 121st Street between Figueroa Street and Hoover Street for 18 months. The closure would be accomplished by installing a gate at one end of the street, not a complete blockade. The proposal requires City Council approval and must comply with several conditions, including approval from the Fire Department, Department of Water and Power, Department of Transportation, and Bureau of Sanitation.\n\n## Why?\nThe closure is intended to reduce criminal activity in the area. According to the Los Angeles Police Department, over 120 crimes occurred in the area over two years, including robberies, assaults, prostitution, and vehicle thefts, primarily along Figueroa Street near the Athens on the Hill community. Police Captain Clint L. Dohmen supports the closure as a crime-reduction strategy.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** 121st Street between Figueroa and Hoover Streets (Council District 15)\n- **Duration:** 18 months\n- **Original Request:** First submitted February 5, 2013; approved and implemented in 2014 but expired when extension wasn't requested\n- **Cost:** Bureau of Engineering absorbs ~$5,000 in processing costs; the property owner/petitioner must install and remove the gate at no cost to the City\n- **Conditions:** Over 30 neighboring residents and organizations were notified and must be involved in cleanup and maintenance\n\n## Impact\nResidents living on and adjacent to 121st Street will experience restricted vehicle access through this section of street. The closure aims to deter criminals from using the street as a thoroughfare for illegal activities while maintaining necessary emergency vehicle and utility access through keyed gates.",

This action requires full City Council approval to take effect.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe street closure is proposed as a gang reduction and public safety measure. The committee found substantial evidence of serious and continual criminal activities occurring on this street. The theory is that closing the street will reduce criminal activity by eliminating vehicle and pedestrian traffic that currently contributes to these crimes. Property owners adjacent to the street have agreed to the closure, indicating community support.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** 121st Street between Figueroa and Hoover Streets\n- **Duration:** 18 months (temporary)\n- **Legal Basis:** California State Vehicle Code Section 21101.4\n- **Cost:** Bureau of Engineering absorbing approximately $5,000 in processing costs; maintenance expenses by City forces will be eliminated\n- **Committee Vote:** Two members voted YES (Buscaino, Price); one ABSENT (Cedillo)\n- **Date Considered:** August 20, 2014\n\n## Impact\n\nResidents and property owners in the area will lose direct vehicular and pedestrian access to this street segment. However, the committee determined this closure will not substantially harm traffic flow on adjacent streets or affect emergency vehicle operations. The primary impact is a public safety measure intended to reduce gang and criminal activity in the neighborhood.",

He references a similar closure that was previously completed at Athens Boulevard and Figueroa Avenue as a precedent for this proposal.\n\n## Rationale and Preferences\nWhile the document does not explicitly state the reasoning behind the street closure proposal, Watson indicates he wants 121st Street and Hoover Street to remain open as an alternative route. This suggests the closure is intended to restrict through-traffic in the area, likely for public safety or community benefit reasons, similar to the Athens and Figueroa closure mentioned.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location**: 121st Street and Figueroa Avenue, Los Angeles\n- **Resident**: Hubert Watson, H.W Property Management\n- **Address**: 618 West Athens Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90044\n- **Contact**: 213-276-1620\n- **Precedent**: The proposal references an existing closure at Athens Boulevard and Figueroa Avenue\n\n## Impact\nThis communication represents a local resident's support for a traffic management decision that would affect vehicle circulation patterns in the area. The closure would redirect traffic from one intersection while keeping an alternative route available through 121st and Hoover open for residents and businesses in the vicinity.",

The closure would be accomplished by installing gates at the street's endpoints, with a physical barrier required within 6 months of City Council approval.\n\n## Why?\n\nResidents and the Los Angeles Police Department have documented serious and persistent criminal activity along this street segment, including prostitution, narcotics sales, burglary, and other crimes. The LAPD believes that closing the street would deter criminal activity by eliminating it as a through-traffic route. Additionally, residents report that apartment dwellers from a nearby development on South Figueroa Street use the street for parking and access, contributing to the problems. The closure is viewed as a crime prevention measure that would improve public safety and quality of life in the neighborhood.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** 121st Street between Figueroa Street and Hoover Street (500 and 600 blocks)\n- **Duration:** 18 months (temporary)\n- **Cost:** Approximately $5,000 to City for processing; installation of gates at no cost to the City\n- **Approval Status:** Affected property owners have agreed to the closure\n- **Requirements:** Gates must be approved by Fire Department, Department of Water and Power, Department of Transportation, and Bureau of Sanitation; property owners must maintain the closed area and remove gates after the closure period ends\n\n## Impact\n\nThis closure primarily affects the 29 property owners and residents along 121st Street. While they will need to access their properties via Hoover Street instead of directly from 121st and Figueroa, they have consented to the measure, believing the crime reduction benefits outweigh the inconvenience. The City Council must find that the closure will not substantially affect traffic flow, emergency services, or commercial delivery to nearby streets.",
