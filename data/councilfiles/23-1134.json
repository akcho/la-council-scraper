REQUEST the City Attorney, with the assistance of the LAHD, to prepare and present a draft Ordinance to amend the RSO, Article 1 of Chapter XV of the LAMC, to revise the methodology to establish the annual allowable rent increase for RSO rental units as follows: Amend the percentage of the Consumer Price Index All-Items for All Urban Consumers to 60% in the methodology to establish the RSO annual allowable rent increase (LAMC 151.06.D and 151.07. A6). Establish a floor of zero percent for annual RSO rent increases. Establish a ceiling of three percent for annual RSO rent increases. Delete the provision that allows an additional one percent or two percent increase for gas and/or electricity. Amend LAMC Section 151.06.G to ensure that additional dependents do not trigger an additional rent increase. INSTRUCT the LAHD to increase funding for residential repair, maintenance, and rehabilitation programs for small landlords owning 2- to 10-units each in the City using appropriate and available resources, including Measure ULA and Los Angeles County Affordable Housing Solutions Agency (LACAHSA) funds that are designed for preservation of the City’s existing housing stock.

      "summary": "# Summary: Rent Stabilization Ordinance Amendment (File 23-1134)\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Housing and Homelessness Committee is recommending changes to how annual rent increases are calculated for Los Angeles's rent-controlled apartments under the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO). The committee wants to reduce the percentage of inflation that triggers rent increases from the current formula to 60%, establish a floor of 0% and a ceiling of 3% for annual increases, eliminate extra increases for gas and electricity costs, and ensure that having more family members doesn't automatically trigger higher rent increases.\n\n## Why These Changes?\n\nThe recommendations are based on an economic study conducted by the Los Angeles Housing Department. The goal is to provide more stability and predictability for rent-controlled tenants while still allowing landlords some compensation for inflation and operating costs. The committee also wants to help small landlords (those owning 2-10 units) with increased funding for maintenance and repairs rather than allowing unlimited rent increases.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe committee voted 3-2 in favor of the recommendations on November 5, 2025 (Raman, Jurado, and Hutt voted yes; Blumenfield and McOsker voted no). The City Attorney has been asked to draft the formal ordinance. The changes would specifically modify Los Angeles Municipal Code sections 151.06.D, 151.07.A6, and 151.06.G. Funding for landlord repair programs would come from Measure ULA and County affordable housing resources.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis directly affects the roughly 600,000 Los Angeles residents living in rent-controlled housing. Tenants would face more predictable, capped rent increases. However, landlords—particularly small property owners—would see their income from rent increases limited, though they'd have access to repair funding programs.",

The proposed changes include: capping rent increases at the lower of 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or 3% with no minimum increase floor, and eliminating additional increases currently allowed for utilities and extra occupants.\n\n## Why?\nThe commenter argues that current rent increases allowed under the RSO are unaffordable for struggling Angelenos. Every percentage point of rent increase reduces money available for other necessities such as food, medical care, transportation, and childcare. The communication emphasizes that the RSO is vital for keeping millions of Angelenos stably housed, but the existing formula enables increases that are pricing people out.\n\n## Key Details and Urgency\nThe timing is critical: new rent increase formulas take effect in July, making immediate City Council action necessary. The communication references demands from the advocacy group \"Keep LA Housed\" and emphasizes that without prompt updates to the RSO formula, tenants will face unaffordable increases under the current system.\n\n## Impact\nThese proposed changes would directly affect Los Angeles renters, particularly low-income and struggling households in CD4 and citywide. Capping increases and eliminating utility and occupancy surcharges would reduce landlord-allowed rent hikes, helping tenants maintain housing stability and afford basic necessities.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Questions for Housing Committee on LARSO Report\n\n## Overview\nCouncilmember Adrin Nazarian has submitted 16 detailed questions to the Los Angeles Housing and Community Investment Department (LAHD) regarding proposed changes to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO). These questions are directed at the Housing Committee and seek clarification on recommendations made in recent LAHD and Economic Roundtable studies about how rent control rules should be adjusted.\n\n## What's Being Proposed\nThe underlying LAHD report recommends several significant changes to Los Angeles' rent control system, including: (1) eliminating the current 1–2% annual utility pass-through allowance for landlords; (2) switching from an \"All-Items\" Consumer Price Index (CPI) to \"All Items Less Shelter\" CPI for calculating annual rent increases; and (3) changing the rent increase floor from 3% to 2% and establishing a 5% ceiling with CPI \"banking\" (allowing unused increases to carry forward). These changes would affect how much rent landlords can raise each year and what cost recovery tools are available.\n\n## Why This Matters\nNazarian's questions focus on balancing two competing concerns: protecting tenants from excessive rent increases while ensuring small \"mom-and-pop\" landlords can maintain their properties and recover legitimate operating costs (utilities, insurance, repairs) as expenses rise. The questions highlight a key tension: small landlords, who operate about 30% of RSO properties, may struggle under stricter rent controls, but giving them higher increases could burden tenants living in those units. The document also references findings that small landlords have lower vacancy rates and more stable occupancy, raising questions about whether perceived hardship matches actual financial performance.\n\n## Key Issues Being Examined\nThe questions probe critical unknowns: How many tenants are already cost-burdened? Have small landlords recovered from the COVID rent freeze (2020–2024), during which they lost about 16% of allowable increases? What barriers prevent landlords from using existing \"Just and Reasonable\" cost-recovery programs? Are small landlords being displaced post-pandemic as property values rise? The councilmember is essentially asking LAHD to provide data and analysis that would clarify whether proposed changes strike the right balance and what alternative tools (grants, loans) might address landlord hardship without raising rents.",

Specifically, she calls for: (1) capping rent increases at 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or 3%, whichever is lower, with no automatic minimum increase; and (2) eliminating additional rent increases for utilities and extra occupants.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe communication addresses affordability concerns within LA's existing rent control system.

      "summary": "# Summary: Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance Annual Rent Increase Formula (CF 23-1134)\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nImmigrants Are Los Angeles, on behalf of the Keep LA Housed Coalition, is urging the City Council to amend the current rent increase formula under the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance (LARSO). The organization proposes adopting a \"3%/60% CPI formula\" that would cap annual allowable rent increases at whichever is lower: 60% of the change in the Consumer Price Index or 3%. The proposal also eliminates utility pass-throughs, prohibits increases for additional tenants, eliminates rent banking, and removes exemptions for small landlords.\n\n## Why?\nLos Angeles tenants face a severe rent burden crisis, with many already forced to choose between paying rent and affording basic necessities like food and medicine. The organization argues that the current formula fails to adequately protect tenants from displacement and homelessness, particularly during periods of high inflation. They contend that the proposed formula is both constitutionally sound and aligns with rent stabilization practices in other California cities, including several in Los Angeles County.\n\n## Key Details\nThe letter emphasizes that each additional percentage point in the annual rent increase formula can determine whether a tenant can afford to remain housed or faces displacement. The organization frames the 3%/60% CPI formula as striking a balance between protecting tenants from unaffordable steep increases and ensuring landlords receive constitutionally reasonable returns on their investments.\n\n## Impact\nThis policy directly affects Los Angeles renters and landlords. Lower rent increase caps would help stabilize housing costs for vulnerable tenants, particularly immigrants and low-income households, while potentially reducing landlord revenue during inflationary periods. The change could influence housing stability and homelessness rates across the city.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Communication from Public on Rent Stabilization Ordinance Updates\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nGina G. is urging the Los Angeles City Council to adopt more tenant-friendly amendments to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (Council File 23-1134). Specifically, she is requesting four key changes: (1) base rent increases on 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) All Items, (2) implement a 3% cap on increases with no minimum floor, (3) eliminate additional charges for utilities and occupant increases, and (4) eliminate rent banking provisions.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe communication addresses Los Angeles' ongoing housing crisis and the problem of escalating rents making it difficult for residents to remain housed. While acknowledging that the Housing Department's current proposal represents some improvement, Gina G. contends these measures are insufficient to adequately protect tenants. The submitter is calling for more aggressive rent stabilization protections.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe submission was filed on August 27, 2025, under Council File No. 23-1134, which specifically concerns rent increases in Los Angeles' Rent Stabilization Ordinance. The proposed changes reference CPI indexing and establish specific numerical caps (3% maximum) rather than allowing flexible increases tied to broader inflation measures.\n\n## Impact\n\nThese changes would directly affect Los Angeles tenants and renters by limiting how much landlords can increase rent annually. The proposals aim to keep lower-income households housed by reducing the financial pressure of rising rents, while potentially affecting property owners' ability to adjust rents for operational costs and occupancy changes.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Communications on Rent Stabilization Ordinance (Council File 23-1134)\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\n\nTwo residents are urging the LA City Council to reform the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) by adopting a new rent increase formula. The proposed changes include: basing rent increases on 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), implementing a 3% cap with no floor, eliminating rent banking, and removing additional charges for utilities and extra occupants.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nCurrent rent increases under the existing RSO formula are unaffordable for struggling Angelenos. New increases based on the old formula just took effect in July 2025, and residents argue that every percentage point of increase forces tenants to cut spending on essential necessities like food, medical care, transportation, and childcare. The commenters emphasize that reform is urgently needed to prevent further displacement and homelessness.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- Average rent in small RSO properties is $2,357/month\n- A renter would need to earn approximately $94,000 annually to maintain the recommended 30% rent-to-income ratio\n- One commenter, Jade Parada from Innercity Struggle (District SD14), represents the advocacy coalition \"Keep LA Housed\"\n- The second commenter (Maria) expressed concerns in Spanish about potential homelessness if rents continue to rise\n\n## Impact\n\nThese changes would primarily benefit low-income and working-class renters throughout Los Angeles who currently live in rent-stabilized units. Implementing the proposed formula would limit rent increases and provide financial relief for vulnerable residents at risk of displacement.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Communications from Public on Council File 23-1134\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThese are two public comments submitted to the Los Angeles City Council regarding housing and rental regulations. The second commenter, Elaine Loring, specifically advocates for revising LARSO (Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance) through the \"Keep LA Housed\" proposal, which calls for: a 3% rent cap based on appropriate CPI (Consumer Price Index), elimination of utility and extra person add-ons, and prohibition of rent banking practices.\n\n## Why?\n\nBoth commenters address the severe housing crisis affecting Los Angeles residents. M. Lopez describes decades of deteriorating conditions in the Palms neighborhood, including gentrification, gang violence, rising rents, and inadequate housing maintenance—forcing her and others to shoulder costs for repairs that management should provide. Elaine Loring argues that \"business as usual\" policies will not solve the challenge of rising rents for Angelenos and calls for more aggressive rent control measures.\n\n## Key Details\n\nM. Lopez has lived in her apartment complex for over 15 years and has raised three children and six grandchildren there. Her units have not been updated in over 50 years, lack air conditioning, have a faulty heating system, and feature only shared coin-operated laundry. She is now disabled and facing knee replacement surgery with no ADA accommodations. Elaine Loring specifically addresses Councilmember Nazarian (CD2) and Councilmember Raman (CD4), referencing Nazarian's previous support for a 3% cap at a February town hall.\n\n## Impact\n\nThese comments directly affect tenants across Los Angeles, particularly middle-class and working-poor residents facing displacement. The proposals would limit rent increases, potentially making housing more affordable and stable, while addressing landlord practices that currently shift maintenance costs to tenants. This impacts both current residents and the broader affordability crisis in the city.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Communications Regarding RSO Rent Increase Formula (Council File 23-1134)\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nMultiple residents are urging the LA City Council to adopt the \"Keep LA Housed\" demands for reforming the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) rent increase formula. The proposed changes include: (1) basing rent increases on 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) All Items, (2) capping increases at 3% with no floor, (3) eliminating rent banking, and (4) removing bumps for utilities and additional occupants.\n\n## Why This Matters\nLA renters currently face unaffordable housing costs, with new rent increases based on the old formula having gone into effect in July 2025 (ranging from 3-5% increases). The average RSO unit rents for $2,357/month, requiring renters to earn approximately $94,000 annually to stay within the recommended 30% rent-to-income ratio. Residents report spending the majority of their income on rent, leaving insufficient funds for food, medical care, transportation, and childcare. The comments emphasize that current rent increases are unsustainable, particularly for vulnerable populations including immigrant families facing ICE enforcement and those displaced by recent fires or job losses.\n\n## Key Details\nAll four commenters submitted statements on August 3, 2025, making identical or near-identical demands. They cite the same data points and urgency, indicating coordinated advocacy. One commenter specifically highlights that over 30% of Asian American renters in Los Angeles face severe housing cost burdens, spending over half their income on rent alone.\n\n## Impact\nThis affects the majority of LA residents who are renters. If adopted, the proposed formula changes would significantly lower allowable rent increases, providing relief to struggling tenants while potentially limiting landlord income from rent increases on stabilized units.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Communication from Public - Council File 23-1134\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nCrystal Santoso is urging the LA City Council to adopt tenant-friendly reforms to the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance (LARSO). Specifically, she advocates for the \"Keep LA Housed Coalition\" proposals, which include: rent increases based on 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a 3% rent cap with no floor, elimination of rent banking, no additional charges for utilities or occupants, and uniform formulas for all landlords and tenants.\n\n## Why?\nThe current rent increase formula allows rents to rise faster than inflation, making housing increasingly unaffordable for renters. The writer emphasizes that even stabilized units are pricing out low-to-moderate income tenants. With average RSO rents at $2,357 monthly, renters would need to earn nearly $94,000 annually to meet the recommended 30% rent-to-income ratio, making it difficult for tenants to afford other necessities like food, medical care, and childcare.\n\n## Key Details\n- The LA Housing Department has already recommended updating the rent formula\n- Rent increases take effect July 1 annually\n- The majority of Angelenos are renters, and most live in stabilized units\n- The submitter (Crystal Santoso, 91801) notes that while the Housing Department's current proposal is an improvement, it remains insufficient\n\n## Impact\nThis affects LA's substantial renter population—particularly low-to-moderate income households—by potentially stabilizing housing costs and preserving affordability. Urgent action is needed before the next rent increase cycle begins.",

The proposed changes would modify how rent increases are calculated, specifically requesting: rent increases based on 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) All Items, a 3% cap with no floor, elimination of rent banking, and removal of bumps for utilities and additional occupants.\n\n## Why?\nThe commenters argue that current RSO rent increases are too high and unaffordable for struggling Angelenos. Research cited shows that a $100 increase in median rent correlates with a 9% increase in homelessness. Even in RSO-protected units, rents are deeply unaffordable—the average rent in small RSO properties is $2,357, requiring renters to earn nearly $94,000 annually to stay within the recommended 30% rent-to-income ratio. The advocates emphasize that rising rents force workers into impossible financial choices between housing and other necessities like food, medical care, and childcare.\n\n## Key Details\nBoth commenters represent organizations serving vulnerable populations (LA CAN and Safe Place for Youth in Venice). Adam Smith also raises urgent secondary concerns about conditions in 17 buildings recently purchased by Hope For An Affordable LA (HALA), demanding immediate on-site mail delivery and restoration of 24/7 tenant-protective security across the HALA portfolio. The comments emphasize urgency, noting that new rent increases go into effect in July 2025.\n\n## Impact\nThese changes would directly affect millions of Los Angeles renters in RSO-protected units by limiting annual rent growth. The advocates frame this as a moral imperative to prevent homelessness and keep low-income tenants housed, particularly affecting workers, at-risk youth, and people experiencing housing instability across Los Angeles.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Communications from Public on LA Rent Stabilization Ordinance (LARSO) - CF 23-1134\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Keep LA Housed Coalition is advocating for reforms to Los Angeles's Rent Stabilization Ordinance. Their specific demands include: (1) capping annual rent increases at 0-3% with no floor, (2) basing increases on 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) All Items rather than the current formula, (3) eliminating \"rent banking\" provisions, and (4) removing additional charges for utilities and additional occupants. These communications urge the Housing and Homelessness Committee to adopt these demands when voting on CF 23-1134.\n\n## Why?\nThe current LARSO formula allows rent increases that are unaffordable for struggling tenants and are a major driver of homelessness. Commenters note that a $100 rent increase correlates with a 9% rise in homelessness. Many tenants are forced to choose between paying rent and affording necessities like food, medicine, and transportation. The average rent for a small RSO unit ($2,357/month) requires an annual income of $94,000 to maintain the recommended 30% rent-to-income ratio—placing housing out of reach for working-class Angelenos.\n\n## Key Details\nMultiple commenters oppose \"rent banking,\" a provision recommended by LAHD in their report on CF 23-1134. Rent banking would allow landlords to accumulate unused rent increases from previous years and apply them later. Critics argue this creates unnecessary administrative burden, confusion, and benefits only landlords. The Economic Roundtable Report does not recommend rent banking adoption. Comments were submitted between July 25-29, 2025, primarily from residents in various city districts, tenant advocacy organizations, legal service providers, and working families groups.\n\n## Impact\nThese proposed changes would directly affect millions of Angelenos, particularly renters in rent-stabilized units, immigrant workers, elderly residents on fixed incomes, and low-wage workers. Advocates argue stronger protections would prevent displacement, reduce homelessness, and allow families to afford basic necessities. The changes aim to ensure housing remains accessible while maintaining the city's economic stability through retained residents.",

The proposed changes include: basing rent increases on 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Items, capping increases at 3% with no minimum floor, eliminating rent banking, and removing additional charges for utilities and additional occupants.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe speaker argues that current allowable rent increases are unaffordable for struggling Angelenos and directly contribute to homelessness. Research cited in the comment shows that a $100 increase in median rent correlates with a 9% increase in homelessness. The speaker frames the housing crisis as fundamentally an affordability problem requiring moral action from city leadership, not politically convenient decisions.\n\n## Key Details and Stakeholders\n\nThe comment also addresses conditions at 17 buildings recently purchased by Hope For An Affordable LA (HALA). Tenants from these buildings submitted a separate letter on June 3, 2025, demanding: (1) immediate, on-site lawful mail delivery for all 15 occupied buildings, and (2) restoration of 24/7 tenant-protective security. The letter was sent to all LA City Council members, the Mayor, Los Angeles Housing Department, and other housing authorities.\n\n## Impact\n\nThese proposals would directly affect millions of Los Angeles renters by limiting rent increases and improving living conditions in HALA-managed buildings.

Her proposal includes five main policy recommendations: (1) universal rent control applying to all rental units with vacancy control protections; (2) creation and expansion of social housing that is publicly owned, democratically controlled, and permanently affordable; (3) conversion of existing properties to social housing through community land trusts; (4) investment in new public housing construction; and (5) enhanced tenant protections including universal bills of rights, expanded just cause eviction protections, accessibility requirements, and cancellation of COVID-19-related rent debt.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nPaulin articulates a crisis of housing affordability in Los Angeles, noting that many working-class residents live \"one or two paychecks away from being unhoused\" due to rising rents. She argues that current Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) protections are insufficient. The comment emphasizes the need to repeal state laws that limit rent control options (California's Costa-Hawkins Act) and federal restrictions on public housing construction (the Faircloth Amendment).\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe comment was submitted on July 25, 2025, and references existing RSO laws as inadequate protections. Paulin identifies specific statutory barriers to her proposed solutions, indicating this relates to broader policy discussions within Council File 23-1134.\n\n## Impact\n\nThese recommendations would directly affect renters throughout Los Angeles, particularly low-income households and disabled individuals, by potentially reducing housing costs, increasing tenant rights, and expanding permanently affordable housing options.",

This communication represents public input supporting stronger rent control protections in the city.\n\n## Why?\nThe commenter frames this proposal as a response to the current housing crisis in Los Angeles. The rationale is that a stricter rent cap would serve two key purposes: (1) protect the city from real estate speculation that drives up housing costs, and (2) prevent families from being evicted due to unaffordable rent increases.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Submitted:** July 9, 2025\n- **Proposed Change:** Update LARSO to a 3% annual rent increase cap\n- **Action Requested:** City council members to vote in favor of this measure\n\n## Impact\nThis proposal would affect all renters in Los Angeles, particularly low-to-moderate income families and long-term tenants vulnerable to displacement. A 3% cap would limit how much landlords could raise rent annually, potentially making housing more stable and affordable for existing tenants, though it could also influence landlord behavior regarding maintenance and new housing development.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Communication from Public on Rent Stabilization Ordinance (Council File 23-1134)\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nNikki Harris, a clinical psychologist from District 5, is urging the City Council to update the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) formula for calculating annual rent increases. She is advocating for the specific demands put forward by Keep LA Housed, which include: basing rent increases on 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items, implementing a 3% cap with no floor, eliminating rent banking, and removing additional charges for utilities and extra occupants.\n\n## Why?\nHarris argues that current rent increases allowed under the RSO are unaffordable for struggling Angelenos and are preventing people from remaining stably housed. She emphasizes that every additional percentage point of rent increase reduces money available for basic necessities like food, medical care, transportation, and childcare. The urgency is heightened because new rent increases go into effect in July 2025.\n\n## Key Details\nHarris provides a stark affordability example: the average rent for a unit in a small RSO property is $2,357 per month, which requires an annual income of approximately $94,000 to stay within the recommended 30% rent-to-income ratio. She notes that even rent-stabilized units are already deeply unaffordable under current formulas, and the Council must vote immediately to prevent further increases.\n\n## Impact\nThis affects all rent-stabilized tenants across Los Angeles, particularly lower-income residents already struggling with housing costs. Harris's personal concern—that she cannot afford to stay in her own home—underscores how the current RSO formula impacts even professional workers.",

Their primary recommendation is to cap rent increases at 3% for all RSO units citywide, including units managed by small landlords. Additional protections proposed include eliminating rent increases tied to additional occupants and prohibiting utility cost pass-throughs to tenants.\n\n## Why?\nThe commenters argue that current rent stabilization protections are outdated and inadequate to address Los Angeles's housing affordability crisis. They emphasize that without stronger protections, working families and long-term residents—particularly those born and raised in the city—cannot afford housing or homeownership. One commenter cites research showing that smaller RSO landlords achieve higher rents and lower vacancies while experiencing no greater financial stress than larger landlords, suggesting that exempting small landlords from caps is not justified.\n\n## Key Details\n- Council File: 23-1134\n- Submission Date: July 4, 2025\n- Comments from: Lyra Kilston, Elizabeth, and Gabbie (Highland Park resident since 2013)\n- Proposed rent cap: 3% annually for all RSO units\n- Proposed protections: No occupancy-based increases; no utility surcharges\n\n## Impact\nThese changes would affect rent-stabilized tenants and landlords across Los Angeles. Stronger protections would help stabilize housing costs for working families and long-term residents, while broader application to small landlords could significantly expand coverage of rent controls citywide.",

The proposed formula would cap annual rent increases at **60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or 3%, whichever is lower**, with no utility pass-throughs, no increases for additional tenants, no rent banking, and no exemptions for small landlords.\n\n## Why?\n\nLos Angeles tenants are facing a severe rent burden crisis, with many already unable to afford basic necessities alongside rent payments. The writer argues that the current LARSO formula fails to adequately protect tenants from displacement and homelessness. The proposed 3%/60% CPI formula would protect tenants during high-inflation years while remaining constitutionally sound and providing reasonable returns for landlords. The letter notes that similar formulas already exist in other California cities, including several in Los Angeles County.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Council File Number:** 23-1134\n- **Submission Date:** May 8, 2025\n- **Proposed Formula:** Lower of 3% or 60% CPI change\n- **Supporting Organization:** Keep LA Housed Coalition, ACCE\n\n## Impact\n\nThis policy would directly affect both tenants and landlords across Los Angeles. Tenants would face more predictable, potentially lower rent increases, reducing displacement risk. Landlords would receive regulated but constitutionally protected returns on their investments. The letter emphasizes that each percentage point matters—small differences could determine whether tenants can remain housed.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Public Comments on Rent Stabilization Ordinance (Council File 23-1134)\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nMultiple community members and advocates are urging the Los Angeles City Council to reform the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) by adopting a new rent increase formula. Specifically, they are requesting that the Council: (1) cap annual rent increases at 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or 3%, whichever is lower, with **no minimum floor**, and (2) eliminate additional rent increase provisions for utilities and extra occupants.\n\n## Why This Change is Needed\nThe current RSO formula is 40 years old and, according to advocates, is unfair to tenants. While CPI increased only 23% over the past decade, rents under the current formula have increased 35%—significantly outpacing inflation. A primary problem is the existing 3% minimum floor, which means rents increase by at least 3% annually even when inflation is zero or negative. Commenters emphasize that these increases are unaffordable for struggling tenants, forcing them to choose between housing and other necessities like food, medical care, transportation, and childcare.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Deadline:** New rent increases go into effect in July 2025, creating urgency\n- **Proposed formula:** 60% CPI with 3% cap and NO floor (some commenters mention 2% as an alternative floor)\n- **Geographic scope:** Changes would apply citywide across multiple districts\n- **Stakeholders:** Advocates include community organizers from SAJE, DSA-LA, Inner City Law Center, Public Counsel, and various neighborhood councils\n\n## Impact\nThis reform would directly affect millions of Los Angeles renters in stabilized housing. Lower and more predictable rent increases would preserve tenants' limited income for essential needs, particularly benefiting low-income and vulnerable renters already struggling with housing affordability across the city.",

Currently, the RSO allows higher increases with a built-in minimum, which commenters argue is unaffordable for renters.\n\n## Why This Matters\nRenters and tenant advocacy groups argue that current rent increase allowances are too high and outpacing wage growth. One commenter described a family member with four school-aged children whose rent increases every year while wages stagnate. Another reported a property manager raising rent 10% for each maintenance visit and threatening eviction. These commenters emphasize that lower rent increases would free up tenant money for necessities like food, medical care, transportation, and childcare.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Deadline for action:** New rent increases take effect in July 2025, making immediate council action urgent\n- **Proposed cap:** 3% maximum with no minimum (or 60% of CPI, whichever is lower)\n- **Additional demand:** Elimination of extra charges for utilities and additional occupants\n- **Affected districts:** Comments submitted from Districts 9, 10, 13, and zip code 90022\n- **Organizations involved:** Keep LA Housed, SAJE (Strategic Actions for a Just Economy)\n\n## Impact\nThese changes would directly affect the hundreds of thousands of Angelenos living under RSO protections by limiting how much landlords can raise rent annually, potentially keeping stable housing more affordable for working families and vulnerable renters.",

They specifically demand that the Council adopt \"Keep LA Housed\" proposals to modify the RSO formula by: (1) capping annual rent increases at 60% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or 3%, whichever is lower, with no minimum increase guarantee, and (2) eliminating additional rent increases currently applied for utilities and extra occupants.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe commenters argue that current rent increase allowances under the RSO are unaffordable and unsustainable for struggling Los Angeles tenants, even though the ordinance is credited with helping keep millions housed. They cite research showing that a $100 increase in median rent correlates with a 9% increase in homelessness. They also contend that charging families extra fees simply for having children or elderly relatives in their household is unjust. Other jurisdictions—LA County, Santa Monica, and West Hollywood—have successfully implemented more reasonable rent caps without harming their housing markets.\n\n## Key Details & Impact\n\n**Urgency:** New rent increases take effect in July 2025, making immediate City Council action critical. **Geographic scope:** The speakers represent Council District 14 (and beyond) and represent renters throughout Los Angeles. **Affected populations:** Primarily low-income families, elderly residents, and households with children who face cost-of-living pressures beyond housing, including food, medical care, transportation, and childcare.

      "summary": "# Summary: Council File 23-1134 – Public Comments on Rent Increase Caps\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe council is considering rent control policy changes for Los Angeles, with multiple public submissions addressing how much rent-controlled (RSO) apartments can increase annually. The primary proposal supported by several commenters is to cap rent increases at **60% of inflation, or 3%, whichever is lower—with no minimum rent hikes**. An alternative recommendation calls for a flat **3% cap with no exceptions** for utilities or small landlords.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nLos Angeles faces a severe affordability crisis. According to the comments, rents across Los Angeles County have increased 54% while incomes have only risen 16%. Tenants in rent-controlled units report devastating cumulative impacts: one long-term resident's rent increased 38% over 20 years ($675 to $1,085), while their income rose only 24% and inflation was 66%. With market-rate studios now reaching $1,700+ monthly, many residents face displacement or homelessness. The underlying problem is described as both insufficient housing supply and escalating landlord costs.\n\n## Key Positions and Stakeholder Concerns\n\n**Tenant advocates** (Vakil, Miller, Carcieri, McFadden) argue that rent increases exceed inflation and income growth, making housing unaffordable even in controlled units. **Housing providers** (Max M, Resnick) counter that caps below inflation force small landlords to absorb rising maintenance, taxes, utilities, and code compliance costs, pushing them out of the market and leading to corporate consolidation. One commenter (Hancock) advocates for a broader federal solution: massive public housing construction and income-based rent (1/8 of monthly income maximum).\n\n## Impact\n\nThis directly affects thousands of rent-controlled tenants and small/large landlords. Stricter caps could provide immediate relief for struggling renters but may reduce housing supply if landlords exit. The broader debate reflects disagreements about whether regulation or supply-side solutions better address affordability.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Communication on RSO Economic Study (CF 23-1134)\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Central City Association (CCA) is expressing support for Councilmember Blumenfield's motion to conduct a comprehensive economic study of the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) annual allowable rent adjustment. The CCA urges the City Council to ensure this review is balanced and includes thorough analysis of current costs and market conditions.\n\n## Why?\nThe RSO has not undergone an extensive review in over a decade, while property owners have been unable to raise rents since March 2020 despite significant cost increases in utilities, trash hauling, insurance, labor, and raw materials. The CCA argues that without adequate financial mechanisms for property owners to cover rising costs, the city's aging housing stock will deteriorate, resulting in fewer quality affordable housing options. The study aims to strike an appropriate balance between protecting tenants and ensuring property owners have incentive to maintain and invest in their properties.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Submitter**: Central City Association, representing approximately 300 member organizations focused on Downtown Los Angeles\n- **Issue**: Rent freeze period: March 2020 to present\n- **Last major RSO review**: Over 10 years ago\n- **Goal**: Produce thoughtful, equitable, and data-informed recommendations rather than rushed conclusions\n\n## Impact\nThis study directly affects both renters and property owners across Los Angeles. Results could influence future rent increase policies, property maintenance standards, and the availability of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income residents and families.",
