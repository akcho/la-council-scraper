APPROVE Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) Board Resolution No. 28221, authorizing a Third Amendment to Contract DA-5605 with Swinerton Builders to reallocate $5,000,000 from the project contingency to the contract authority, increasing the amount from $234,095,953 to $239,095,953 without changing the overall project budget of $289,737,127, and extending the contract term by 13 months, through February 26, 2027, to complete offsite roadway improvements for the Landside Access Modernization Program Intermodal Transportation Facility Auxiliary Curbs Project at Los Angeles International Airport. AUTHORIZE the LAWA Chief Executive Officer, or designee, to execute the proposed Third Amendment with Swinerton Builders upon approval as to form by the City Attorney and approval by the City Council. Fiscal Impact Statement: The City Administrative Officer reports that approval of the proposed Third Amendment to Contract DA-5605 with Swinerton Builders will have no impact on the City’s General Fund. The contract authority will be increased from $234,095,953 to 239,095,953 through an internal transfer of $5,000,000 from the existing project contingency. The total maximum contract amount of $289,737,127 remains unchanged. Funding for the ITF Project is located in LAWA’s Work Breakdown Structure Element 1.23.04A-700 (ITF Auxiliary Curbs) account. This project is included in the Department’s 2024 Investment Plan and programmed in LAWA’s Capital Improvement Plan (CIP). Costs associated with the proposed Third Amendment will not result in a net increase to the LAWA’s CIP. The recommendations in this report comply with the Los Angeles World Airports’ adopted Financial Policies.

      "summary": "# Summary: LAX Auxiliary Curbs Project Contract Amendment\n\n## What is Being Proposed\nThe Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee is recommending City Council approval of a Third Amendment to the construction contract with Swinerton Builders for offsite roadway improvements at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). The amendment would reallocate $5 million from the project's contingency fund to the main contract, increase the total contract amount from $234 million to $239 million, and extend the project completion deadline by 13 months to February 26, 2027.\n\n## Why This is Needed\nThe amendment addresses funding and scheduling needs for the Landside Access Modernization Program's Intermodal Transportation Facility (ITF) Auxiliary Curbs Project. The $5 million reallocation and 13-month extension appear necessary to complete the offsite roadway work as currently planned.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Contract:** DA-5605 with Swinerton Builders\n- **Funding reallocation:** $5 million from project contingency to contract authority\n- **New contract amount:** $239,095,953 (previously $234,095,953)\n- **Overall project budget:** Remains unchanged at $289,737,127\n- **New completion date:** February 26, 2027\n- **Committee vote:** Unanimous approval (Park, McOsker, Rodriguez all voted YES)\n- **Date:** October 28, 2025 committee meeting\n\n## Impact\nThis affects LAX operations and airport access improvements. The financial impact on the City is neutral—no new funding is required, as the money comes from existing project reserves. The work will continue modernizing ground transportation access to the airport.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Third Amendment to Contract DA-5605 with Swinerton Builders\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Board of Airport Commissioners is requesting City Council approval for a Third Amendment to an existing contract with Swinerton Builders. The amendment would add $5,000,000 to the project allowance and extend the contract term by 13 months to complete offsite work related to the Landside Access Modernization Program at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).\n\n## Why?\nThe document does not explicitly state the reasons for the amendment. However, the extension of the contract timeline and increased funding suggest that additional work or unforeseen circumstances require more time and resources to complete the Intermodal Transportation Facility Auxiliary Curbs Project—part of LAX's broader modernization effort to improve ground transportation access.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Contractor:** Swinerton Builders\n- **Contract Number:** DA-5605\n- **Additional Funding:** Up to $5,000,000\n- **Contract Extension:** 13 months\n- **Project:** Landside Access Modernization Program Intermodal Transportation Facility Auxiliary Curbs Project at LAX\n- **Approved by:** Board of Airport Commissioners on August 21, 2025 (Resolution 28221)\n- **Impact to General Fund:** None\n\n## Impact\nThis action affects LAX operations and transportation infrastructure improvements. There is no financial impact to the City's General Fund, suggesting the project is funded through airport revenues rather than general tax dollars. The extended timeline may affect the overall modernization program schedule at LAX.",
