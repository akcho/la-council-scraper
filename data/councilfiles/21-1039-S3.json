      "summary": "# Summary: Municipal Solar and Battery Storage Master Plan\n\n## What is Being Proposed\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to approve two main recommendations from the Government Operations and Energy and Environment Committees. First, the Bureau of Engineering and LA Department of Water and Power (LADWP) should prioritize large City parcels, properties, and parking lots for solar panels and energy storage systems in their decarbonization master plan. Second, these agencies should specifically study the feasibility of adding solar and battery storage to LAPD properties, with special emphasis on the Canoga Park Police Station and its parking lot located at 21501 Schoenborn Street.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nLos Angeles has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy (LA100) and has adopted multiple plans to achieve this, including building electrification and electric vehicle rollout strategies. The City owns approximately 1,000 properties that could potentially be used for renewable energy generation and storage. By strategically deploying solar and battery systems on large municipal properties—particularly in hot areas like Canoga Park and the West San Fernando Valley—the City can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower its own energy bills, and maximize renewable energy generation for the power grid.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe Canoga Park Police Station, operational since January 2009, is specifically identified as a priority location due to the region's high temperatures and its large available surface area. The report directs the agencies to consider federal and state incentive programs and to determine the best procurement methods for these projects, such as Net-Energy Metering, Feed-In-Tariff programs, or Municipal Solar and Energy Resiliency projects. Both committees unanimously approved this motion on October 21, 2025.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis initiative will help Los Angeles meet its climate goals while generating energy savings for the City. Residents, particularly those in the San Fernando Valley, will benefit from a more resilient power grid and reduced greenhouse gas emissions in their community. The City will need to invest in feasibility studies and implementation but stands to recover costs through reduced energy bills and potential revenue generation.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Motion on Renewable Energy for City Properties\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThis motion directs the Bureau of Engineering and requests the Department of Water and Power (LADWP) to prioritize renewable energy and battery storage systems on Los Angeles city properties as part of the LA100 strategy—a citywide goal to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2035. Specifically, the motion asks these departments to ensure that the municipal electrification and solar battery decarbonization master plan focuses on large city parcels and properties that can significantly lower municipal solar bills and maximize renewable energy generation and storage.\n\n## Why?\n\nLos Angeles has committed to the LA100 strategy through City Council, which requires all city energy to come from renewable sources. The city owns nearly 1,000 properties that could potentially host renewable energy systems and storage. Currently, a comprehensive plan is being developed by the Bureau of Engineering in collaboration with LADWP and other agencies, but the motion seeks to ensure that priority is given to high-impact properties that will generate the most renewable energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and generate revenue or reduce power costs.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe motion specifically highlights the **LAPD Community Police Station at 21501 Schoenborn St. in Canoga Park** as a priority location for solar generation and battery storage due to high temperatures in that area. The motion references council file 21-1039 and requests a report on the feasibility of adding solar and energy storage assets to LAPD properties and parking lots, with particular focus on the Canoga Park Police Station.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects all Los Angeles residents by accelerating the city's path to renewable energy and reducing municipal energy costs. City departments will need to identify and prioritize properties for solar installation, benefiting taxpayers through lower power bills and advancing environmental goals through reduced emissions.",
