      "summary": "# Summary: Final Map of Tract No. 84622\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to approve the final subdivision map for Tract No. 84622, located at 1361 South Kelton Avenue in Council District 5. This approval would allow the conversion of one existing lot into 15 residential condominiums.\n\n## Background and Rationale\nThe project received conditional approval from the Deputy Advisory Agency on January 15, 2025. The City Engineer's report confirms that all conditions of approval have been fulfilled, including required fee payments and completion of public street improvements. The Advisory Agency determined the project will not have significant environmental impacts. Under California Government Code Section 66458, the Council must approve the final map if it meets all previously established conditions.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** 1361 South Kelton Ave, south of Rochester Avenue (Council District 5)\n- **Project:** Subdivision into 15 residential condominiums\n- **Processing Fee:** $9,064 (already paid by subdivider)\n- **Tentative Map Approval Expiration:** January 15, 2028\n- **Owner:** 1361 Kelton LLC (Calabasas)\n- **Surveyor:** Bryan Gentry, Gentry Surveying Company (Simi Valley)\n\n## Impact\nOnce approved, the final map will be transmitted to the County Engineer for recording with the County Recorder, making the subdivision officially legal. This project adds 15 new residential units to the area with no additional costs to the City.",
