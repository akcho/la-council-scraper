      "summary": "# Summary: Beacon Street and 16th Street Street Lighting Maintenance Assessment District\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Bureau of Street Lighting is proposing to establish a new street lighting maintenance assessment district for Beacon Street and 16th Street in Los Angeles. The City Council is being asked to adopt an Ordinance of Intention that would initiate a formal assessment process under Proposition 218, requiring property owners to vote on whether to approve annual assessments to pay for operating and maintaining four streetlights in this area.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe City uses property assessments to finance approximately 80% of its street lighting maintenance and operations costs, with the remainder funded through the Department of Water and Power. Proposition 218 (the \"Right to Vote on Taxes Act\") requires that property owners must approve such assessments through a weighted ballot vote before they can be levied. This proposed district would fund the costs of energy, maintenance, repairs, and administration for the new lighting system.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** Beacon Street (from 16th Street to Palos Verdes Street) and 16th Street (from Palos Verdes Street to Beacon Street)\n- **Affected parcels:** 5 properties\n- **Total streetlights:** 4\n- **Proposed annual assessment:** $985.72 total district-wide\n- **Tax year:** 2025/2026\n- **Project type:** Proposed private development project\n- **Assessment rates:** Based on land use and benefit zones (ranging from $38.11 to $698.64 per property)\n\n## Impact\n\nProperty owners in the district will receive ballots and notices regarding the proposed assessment. If weighted \"yes\" votes equal or exceed weighted \"no\" votes, the assessments will be confirmed and added to property tax rolls. If \"no\" votes exceed \"yes\" votes, the district will be abandoned and the street lighting system will not be constructed. Affected property owners can file protests or appeals before the public hearing.",
