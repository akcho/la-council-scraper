      "summary": "# Summary: List of Citywide Special Events - File 25-0986\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Public Works Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council adopt a list of citywide special events prepared by the Chief Legislative Analyst (CLA). This list follows the City's established Special Event Permit Procedure outlined in Ordinance No. 180881. Notably, the recommendation includes an amendment that replaces the original Council District 10 recommendations with a revised list and budget amounts provided in a separate communication from CD 10.\n\n## Why?\nThe City has a formal procedure for managing special events across Los Angeles. By adopting an official list, the City establishes which events receive permits and potentially city support or resources. The amendment to CD 10's recommendations suggests that the district submitted changes to the originally proposed list, which the committee incorporated into their recommendation.\n\n## Key Details\n- The Public Works Committee met on September 10, 2025, and voted to approve the motion\n- Three committee members voted yes: Hernandez, Padilla, and Hutt\n- The motion was originally initiated by Councilmembers Hernandez and Lee\n- Notably, **no fiscal impact analysis has been completed** by either the City Administrative Officer or the CLA\n- No community impact statement was submitted\n\n## Impact\nThis decision affects how special events are organized and permitted across the city. The amendment process shows that individual council districts have input into which events in their areas are officially recognized and supported. However, without a completed financial analysis, the full cost implications for the city remain unclear.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Council District 10 Amendment - Cultural Festival Funding\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nCouncil District 10 is proposing to replace its recommended funding allocations for cultural festivals and community events with a new list of 23 events totaling $568,300. This amendment specifies which festivals and community celebrations will receive funding and in what amounts, ranging from $2,400 to $75,000 per event.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe funded events include major cultural celebrations such as Dia De Los Muertos on Adams ($75,000), LA84 Play Day ($75,000), Koreatown Parade & Festival ($58,000), Taste of Soul ($50,000), and various other community festivals representing diverse neighborhoods and cultures. Other significant recipients include West Adams Avenue's Jazz and Music Festival ($27,000), Leimert Park Jazz Festival ($25,000), and Guatemala Culture Fest ($30,000), among others. The events span the full spectrum of District 10's communities, including African American, Latino, Asian, and other cultural groups.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis funding directly supports community engagement and cultural celebration in Council District 10. The allocation prioritizes grassroots cultural events that strengthen community identity and foster neighborhood cohesion across diverse populations. Residents in these neighborhoods will benefit from enhanced public celebrations and festivals that receive official city support through this dedicated funding.",
