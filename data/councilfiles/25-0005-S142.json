      "summary": "# Summary: REAP Case No. 864023 – Property Removal Request\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD) is recommending that the City Council remove 815 S Bonnie Brae Street (a 28-unit apartment building) from the Rent Escrow Account Program (REAP). This action would terminate the rent reductions currently in place for one unit and close the escrow account that was established to hold rent payments while code violations were being corrected.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe property was placed into REAP in May 2025 after code enforcement cited five violations related to sanitation, maintenance, and plumbing/gas issues in unit #111. According to LAHD's independent evaluation, the property owner has since corrected all cited violations and paid outstanding utility charges. Because the violations have been resolved and all compliance requirements met under Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 162.08, LAHD believes the property should be removed from the program.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Property:** 815 S Bonnie Brae Street, Los Angeles CA 90057 (28 total units)\n- **REAP Case Number:** 864023\n- **Case Opened:** May 15, 2025\n- **Units in REAP:** 1 (unit #111)\n- **Violations Cited:** 5 violations (sanitation, maintenance, plumbing/gas)\n- **Current Status:** All violations corrected\n- **Scheduled Vote:** November 12, 2025 City Council meeting\n\n## Impact\n\nTenants in the affected unit will see rent restored to original levels 30 days after notification. The escrow funds will be distributed first to cover LAHD administrative fees and any outstanding fines or registration fees, with any remaining balance returned to the landlord. The property owner must also prepay for two additional annual inspections beyond standard code enforcement requirements.",

      "summary": "# Summary: REAP Removal for 815 S Bonnie Brae Street\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD) is recommending that the City Council remove a 28-unit apartment building at 815 S Bonnie Brae Street from the Rent Escrow Account Program (REAP) and terminate rent reductions for tenants. The proposal also calls for releasing escrow funds held by the city and restoring rent to normal levels 30 days after tenants are notified.\n\n## Why?\n\nREAP is a code enforcement tool that places properties in escrow when landlords fail to maintain buildings safely. In this case, one unit (Unit #111) at the property was placed into REAP in May 2025 after inspectors found five violations related to sanitation, maintenance, and plumbing/gas issues. LAHD determined that the property owner has corrected all cited violations, paid outstanding utility charges to the Department of Water and Power, and completed the required work to the satisfaction of LAHD's Code Enforcement Division.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Case Number:** 864023 (one of seven REAP cases being removed)\n- **Property:** 815 S Bonnie Brae St, Los Angeles CA 90057 (28 total units)\n- **Case Opened:** May 15, 2025\n- **Units Affected:** 1 unit in REAP\n- **Status:** All violations corrected\n- **Scheduled Hearing:** November 12, 2025, City Council meeting\n\n## Impact\n\nTenants in Unit #111 will see their rents restored to original levels after a 30-day notice period. The property owner will receive any remaining escrow funds after LAHD deducts administrative fees and inspection costs. The city will also conduct expedited inspections and require the owner to prepay for two additional annual inspections.",

      "summary": "# Summary: REAP Removal for 815 S Bonnie Brae Street\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD) is requesting City Council approval to remove the property at 815 S Bonnie Brae Street from the Rent Escrow Account Program (REAP) and terminate the rent reductions that were imposed on its 28 units. This recommendation will be heard at the City Council meeting on November 12, 2025.\n\n## Why?\nThe property was placed into REAP in May 2025 after being cited for housing code violations (weatherproofing and plumbing/gas issues). REAP is an enforcement tool that allows the city to reduce rents and place collected funds into escrow to incentivize landlords to fix violations. The property owner has now corrected all cited violations to LAHD's satisfaction, paid outstanding utility charges to the Department of Water and Power, and received approval from the oversight contractor Strategic Actions for a Just Economy. Since compliance has been achieved, the program can be terminated.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Property**: 815 S Bonnie Brae Street, Los Angeles CA 90057 (APN 5142-004-024)\n- **Units affected**: 28 total units\n- **Case number**: 877520\n- **Timeline**: Opened May 15, 2025; violations corrected; now being recommended for removal\n- **Associated costs**: The owner must prepay for two annual inspections beyond standard fees\n\n## Impact\nFor tenants, rents will be restored to original levels 30 days after notice is mailed. Escrow funds will be distributed first to cover LAHD administrative fees and penalties, then any remaining funds returned to the landlord. The property will exit the enforcement program but remain subject to ongoing inspections and compliance requirements.",
