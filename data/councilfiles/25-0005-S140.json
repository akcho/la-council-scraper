      "summary": "# Summary: LAHD REAP Removal Recommendation\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD) is requesting the City Council to terminate rent reductions and remove three residential properties from the Rent Escrow Account Program (REAP). The properties are located at 10520 W Eastborne Ave (Los Angeles), 2300 S Pisani Pl (Venice), and 837 W 165th Pl (Gardena). The action is scheduled for the November 5, 2025 City Council meeting.\n\n## Why This Action?\n\nREAP is a code enforcement program that places properties into escrow when landlords violate housing codes—allowing rent reductions to be held in escrow until violations are corrected. All three properties have now met the requirements under Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 162.08 by correcting their code violations. The property owner(s) have also paid outstanding utility charges to the Department of Water and Power, and an independent contractor has verified completion of required repairs.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Case No. 573692** (2300 S Pisani Pl, Venice): Owned by Second Chance Organization LLC; 2 units in REAP since December 15, 2016; originally cited for 27 violations including fire safety, sanitation, plumbing, heating, and illegal construction\n- All violations have been corrected and verified by LAHD's Code Enforcement Division\n- Upon removal, rent will be restored to original levels 30 days after tenant notification; escrow funds will cover administrative fees and other penalties, with remaining funds returned to the landlord\n\n## Impact\n\nTenants at these properties will see their rents return to pre-REAP levels within 30 days. The removal signals that violations have been successfully remedied, though the properties will remain subject to ongoing inspections and fees.",
