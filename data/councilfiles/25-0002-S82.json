      "summary": "# Summary: AB 1088 State Legislative Support\n\n## What is Being Proposed\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to add support for Assembly Bill 1088 (AB 1088) to the City's 2025-26 State Legislative Program. This bill would regulate kratom products containing 7-hydroxymitragynine under California's Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law and prohibit their sale to people under 21 years old.\n\n## Why This Matters\nThe bill addresses concerns about kratom abuse, which has increased in recent years. While some people use kratom as a potential treatment for opioid addiction (according to the National Institutes of Health), the Drug Enforcement Administration reports a rise in kratom abuse with documented cases of psychosis. Individuals addicted to kratom have exhibited psychiatric symptoms including hallucinations, delusions, and confusion.\n\n## Key Details\nThe Rules, Elections and Intergovernmental Relations Committee voted unanimously (5-0) on October 21, 2025, to recommend the Council approve this resolution. The bill would specifically target kratom products and require age restrictions similar to other regulated substances. No fiscal impact or community impact statements were submitted.\n\n## Impact\nThis action establishes the City's official position supporting state-level regulation of kratom products. If passed at the state level, the bill would protect minors from access to kratom while allowing continued regulation as a controlled substance, potentially protecting public health from documented abuse-related psychiatric complications.",

      "summary": "# Summary: AB 1088 Kratom Regulation Support\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to support AB 1088 (Bains), a state bill that would regulate kratom products by adding them to California's Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law. The bill would prohibit selling kratom and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH) products to anyone under 21 years old, require child-resistant packaging, ban products attractive to children, and limit 7-OH concentration to 2% or less of total alkaloids.\n\n## Why This Matters\nKratom, a plant-based product currently legal and widely sold online and in stores across the U.S., has seen increased abuse in recent years. The Drug Enforcement Administration reports rising cases of psychosis linked to kratom addiction, with users experiencing hallucinations, delusions, and confusion. Additionally, some kratom products contain harmful contaminants like heavy metals and disease-causing bacteria. California accounts for nearly 25% of the $1.3 billion kratom industry, making regulation particularly relevant locally.\n\n## Key Details\nAn estimated 1.7 million Americans used kratom in 2021. From 2011-2017, poison control centers received 1,807 calls related to kratom exposure. Kratom costs $9-20 per ounce and produces effects ranging from stimulant (small doses) to opioid-like (moderate-high doses) to sedative (very high doses). The FDA named kratom a \"substance of concern\" in 2022. Other California cities—San Diego, Oceanside, and Newport Beach—have already banned kratom sales.\n\n## Who This Affects\nThis primarily affects young people (under 21) who may use kratom, businesses selling kratom products, and public health agencies managing kratom-related health emergencies. Passage would make Los Angeles part of a broader state effort to regulate a largely uncontrolled substance market.",
