      "summary": "# Summary: Alley Vacation Request - Exposition Boulevard\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City is initiating vacation proceedings to remove the alley located south of Exposition Boulevard between Bundy Drive and Amherst Avenue from the public street system. This is the first step in a formal process that does not yet constitute approval of the vacation.\n\n## Why?\n\nPetitioner Alex Moore, representing property owner Bundy Expo LLC, is requesting the vacation to facilitate future development of a residential mixed-use building on the property. The developer plans to repurpose a portion of the alley for pedestrian access between buildings and vehicular access to parking areas.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Case Number:** VAC-E1401470\n- **Application Date:** September 15, 2025\n- **Deposit Paid:** $14,980.00 (for investigation costs)\n- **Property Address:** 429 Santa Monica Boulevard\n- **Council District:** 11\n- **Next Steps:** The Bureau of Engineering will investigate feasibility and report back to the Public Works Committee\n\n## Impact\n\nThis action initiates a formal review process but does not guarantee the vacation will be approved. The community and affected parties will have opportunities to comment during the investigation phase. Any additional costs beyond the initial deposit will be the petitioner's responsibility.",
