Report on allowable uses for these parcels under DWP Right-of-Way policies, applicable zoning, public safety regulations, and any future plans for these parcels. Explore the feasibility of enhancing these parcels for community-serving purposes such as passive and active recreation, gathering areas, development of a dog park, and shade infrastructure (e.g., trees, gazebos, canopies, or other shade shelters). Engage with local stakeholders and community organizations to gather input and assess interest in potential uses. Report to the Council within 90 days with findings and recommendations, including potential pilot programs or partnerships that could activate these sites as shared-use spaces. Fiscal Impact Statement: Neither the City Administrative Officer nor the CLA has completed a financial analysis of this report.

      "summary": "# Summary: Ilex Avenue Transmission Line Parcels Community Use Study\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Energy and Environment Committee is recommending that the City conduct a comprehensive study of Department of Water and Power (DWP)-owned land parcels along Ilex Avenue in Sun Valley (from Snelling Street to Telfair Avenue) to determine how these underutilized spaces beneath and adjacent to transmission lines could be converted into community assets. The committee has unanimously approved a motion requesting that DWP, working with multiple city departments and the community, assess the feasibility of transforming these parcels into recreational and gathering spaces.\n\n## Why This Matters?\n\nThese parcels currently sit unused beneath high-voltage transmission infrastructure in a residential neighborhood. The motion aims to identify ways to activate these spaces for community benefit while addressing any safety concerns. By involving local stakeholders and assessing feasibility through city departments, the goal is to find practical solutions that could improve neighborhood livability without compromising utility operations or public safety.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe study must be completed within **90 days** and will include: a site assessment evaluating current conditions and safety/liability concerns; a review of allowable uses under DWP policies and zoning regulations; and exploration of specific amenities such as passive/active recreation areas, gathering spaces, a dog park, and shade structures (trees, gazebos, canopies). The committee unanimously approved the measure, and community engagement is a required component of the process.\n\n## Who This Affects\n\nSun Valley residents stand to gain potential new community spaces and recreational opportunities. The study involves multiple city departments (DWP, Recreation and Parks, Bureau of Street Services, Bureau of Engineering) and requires input from local organizations and stakeholders.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Motion to Evaluate LADWP Land for Community Space in Sun Valley\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Council is requesting the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), in coordination with the Community Land Authority (CLA) and other city departments, to assess LADWP-owned parcels along Ilex Avenue in Sun Valley (between Snelling and Telfair streets) for potential conversion into community spaces. The motion asks for a site assessment, feasibility study, stakeholder engagement, and a report back to the City Council within 90 days with recommendations for possible pilot programs or partnerships.\n\n## Why?\nSun Valley and similar neighborhoods lack sufficient recreational spaces and shade. These LADWP parcels are currently underutilized, unfenced, and directly in front of residential homes. The motion argues that converting these transmission corridor lands into accessible community spaces could improve residents' quality of life while maintaining LADWP's operational and safety requirements. Similar partnerships between LADWP and communities across Los Angeles have successfully created compatible uses on utility land.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** Ilex Avenue, Sun Valley, Council District 6 (from Snelling to Telfair Avenue)\n- **Owner:** Los Angeles Department of Water and Power\n- **Potential Uses:** Passive/active recreation, community gardens, tree planting, shade structures, dog parks, and gathering areas\n- **Timeline:** 90-day report deadline with findings and recommendations\n\n## Impact\nResidents of Sun Valley would benefit from new public gathering spaces and shade infrastructure. The motion requires community input and stakeholder engagement to ensure proposed uses meet neighborhood needs while respecting safety and utility requirements.",
