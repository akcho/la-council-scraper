      "summary": "# Summary: File 25-1009 – Hotel Development at West Pico Boulevard\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Planning and Land Use Management (PLUM) Committee is recommending approval of a new hotel development on two properties in South Los Angeles: 2250–2270 West Pico Boulevard and 1309–1315 South Arapahoe Street. The project involves rezoning the land and amending the General Plan to allow construction of two six-story hotel buildings (76.5 feet tall) containing 125 guest rooms and approximately 77,828 square feet of floor space, with 84 underground parking spaces across three levels.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe project requires a General Plan Amendment (changing the area's designation from Commercial Manufacturing to Neighborhood Commercial) and a zone change to proceed. The developer, Min Chun Helen Chen and Da Yuh Development Inc., must demolish an existing market and surface parking to make way for the new development. The city conducted an environmental review (Mitigated Negative Declaration) and determined that with mitigation measures in place, the project will not have significant environmental impacts. No trees will be removed from the site.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** 2250–2270 West Pico Boulevard and 1309–1315 South Arapahoe Street\n- **Project Size:** 125 guest rooms, 77,828 sq ft, 2.99:1 floor area ratio\n- **Height:** Two buildings, each 76 feet 6 inches tall\n- **Parking:** 84 spaces in underground parking\n- **Demolition:** 9,627 sq ft market and surface parking\n- **Environmental Review:** No. ENV-2018-3545-MND\n- **Council Deadline:** November 7, 2025 (last day for action)\n\n## Impact\n\nThe PLUM Committee voted 4–1 in favor (one absent), recommending the City Council approve the project. The applicant must comply with mitigation conditions and maintain them throughout the project's life. If the qualified zoning classification is not developed within six years, it will expire and revert to previous zoning. The project has no projected General Fund impact, as administrative costs are covered through fees.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Hotel Development at Pico Boulevard and Arapahoe Street\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles City Planning Commission is recommending approval of a new 125-room hotel development at 2250-2270 West Pico Boulevard and 1309-1315 South Arapahoe Street in South Los Angeles. The project consists of two six-story buildings (76 feet 6 inches tall) separated by an alley, with 77,828 square feet of floor area and a 2.99:1 Floor Area Ratio. The developer proposes 84 voluntary parking spaces in underground parking, plus 12 bicycle parking spaces.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe project requires a General Plan Amendment to change the land use designation from \"Commercial Manufacturing and Low Medium II\" to \"Neighborhood Commercial,\" along with a zone change from [Q]C2-1 and RD1.5-1 to C2-2-CPIO. The existing zoning severely limits development potential—the commercial portion allows only 1.5:1 FAR, and the residential portion doesn't permit hotels. The City Planning Commission found that the hotel addresses an identified shortage of hotel rooms in proximity to Downtown LA and would revitalize an underutilized site on a major commercial corridor with good transit access.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Vote:** 8-0 approval by the Planning Commission on March 13, 2025\n- **Location:** Southwest corner of Pico Boulevard and Arapahoe Street, Council District 1\n- **Project specs:** 125 guest rooms, demolition of existing market and surface parking, zero trees removed, 24,900 cubic yards of soil grading\n- **Environmental review:** Mitigated Negative Declaration approved (ENV-2018-3545-MND)\n- **Transit access:** Site is within a Transit Priority Area near Metro bus lines 2, 30, 33, 204, and 754\n- **Council action deadline:** 75 or 90 days from August 18, 2025\n\n## Impact\n\nThe project will enhance a commercial corridor by replacing a single-story market with a modern hotel that serves tourists, business travelers, and visitors. Residential neighbors to the south will have an approximately 76-foot tall building 15-18 feet away, though the project includes design features like an open courtyard and alley widening to minimize impacts. The development requires significant public improvements including street dedications, sidewalk construction, and infrastructure upgrades, with multiple conditions of approval governing construction activities, environmental protections, and design standards.",

      "summary": "# Summary: 2250 West Pico Boulevard Hotel Development\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Planning Commission is recommending approval of a General Plan Amendment, Zone Change, Height District Change, and Conditional Use Permit to allow construction of a new 125-room hotel at 2250 West Pico Boulevard in South Los Angeles. The project involves demolishing an existing single-story market and surface parking to build two connected six-story buildings (76 feet 6 inches tall) with 77,828 square feet of floor area and a 2.99:1 Floor Area Ratio (FAR).\n\n## Why This Matters?\nThe current zoning restricts development of this underutilized site. The northern portion is zoned for commercial manufacturing with only a 1.5:1 FAR limit, while the southern portion is zoned for residential and doesn't permit hotels. The project addresses a documented shortage of hotel rooms in Los Angeles—the city has grown hotel supply at only 0.9% annually compared to the national rate of 1.8%. The site is strategically located near Downtown LA, along transit corridors, and serves both tourists and business travelers.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** Southwestern corner of Pico Boulevard and Arapahoe Street\n- **Site size:** Approximately 28,003 square feet across seven lots\n- **Project components:** 125 guest rooms (95 studios, 28 suites, 2 ADA-compliant), 84 voluntary parking spaces (subterranean), pool, meeting spaces\n- **Zoning change:** From [Q]C2-1 and RD1.5-1 to C2-2-CPIO (Neighborhood Commercial)\n- **Parking:** All parking below-grade; no curb cuts proposed; electric vehicle charging required\n\n## Impact\nThe project will add hotel capacity near major employment centers and tourist destinations while activating an underutilized site with street-level pedestrian activity. It complies with the General Plan Framework, which identifies Pico Boulevard as a Mixed-Use Boulevard. The project is compatible with surrounding commercial and multi-family residential uses and is located within a transit priority area served by Metro bus lines 2, 30, 33, 204, and 754.",

Pico Boulevard\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe document presents architectural plans and designs for a new Holiday Inn Express hotel to be constructed at 2250 W. Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles (near the corner of W. Pico Blvd and Arapahoe Street). The project involves a multi-story hotel development with ground-floor commercial/retail space and hotel rooms across multiple floors, along with structured parking and associated amenities.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe project includes two main buildings interconnected by a shared courtyard/atrium space. Building 1 appears to contain most of the hotel rooms organized on upper floors, while Building 2 houses additional guest rooms. The ground floor features retail/commercial spaces, a lobby, restaurant/dining areas, and back-of-house functions. The design incorporates contemporary architecture with exterior finishes including cement stucco (painted in various colors), stone elements, and storefront systems. The project includes landscaping with street trees and pedestrian-oriented ground-level design facing W. Pico Boulevard.\n\n## Impact and Significance\n\nThis development would add hotel capacity to the West Los Angeles area and activate the street frontage along Pico Boulevard with ground-floor retail and hospitality uses. The project affects the immediate neighborhood by introducing increased foot traffic, commercial activity, and employment opportunities while also requiring adequate parking and traffic management. The architectural design emphasizes compatibility with the surrounding urban context through varied material finishes and a human-scale street presence.",

These are detailed requirements that the developer must follow during construction and ongoing operations. The conditions were modified at the Commission's meeting on March 13, 2025, and cover everything from building design and height restrictions to environmental protections and construction management.\n\n## Why These Conditions Matter?\nThese conditions exist to protect the public interest by ensuring the project complies with city planning standards, minimizes impacts on nearby residents and schools, and incorporates sustainable design features. The conditions address concerns about noise, traffic, building appearance, environmental impacts, and pedestrian safety during the construction and operation phases.\n\n## Key Details\n**Project Specifications:** Maximum 125 guest rooms, 76 feet 6 inches tall, with 77,828 square feet of floor space. The project provides 84 parking spaces (though none are required under AB 2097). **Design Requirements:** The building must include varied rooflines, recesses, and material changes for visual interest, with mechanical equipment screened from view and decorative walls along the alleyway. **Construction Constraints:** Work limited to 7am-6pm weekdays and 8am-6pm Saturdays, with haul trucks restricted to 9am-3pm and limited to two vehicles at a time. **School Protections:** Contractors must coordinate with nearby Magnolia Avenue Elementary, Berends Middle, and W Adams High schools to maintain safe pedestrian and bus routes.\n\n## Impact\nThese conditions primarily affect the developer/applicant, who must comply with all requirements before and during construction. Residents near the project benefit from noise limits, traffic management, improved pedestrian safety, and landscaping requirements. The developer also faces significant financial obligations, including an initial litigation deposit of at least $50,000 to cover potential City legal costs related to project challenges.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Conditions for Tentative Classification Removal\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThis document outlines the specific conditions required to remove the \"(T) Tentative Classification\" from a property (Case No. CPC-2018-3544) located at the intersection of Pico Boulevard and Arapahoe Street in Los Angeles. The tentative classification is a planning designation that restricts development until certain public improvements and dedications are completed. The document details what the developer must accomplish before this restriction can be lifted.\n\n## Why?\nThe tentative classification ensures that development does not proceed until the property adequately contributes to necessary public infrastructure improvements. This protects both the city and residents by requiring developers to address impacts on streets, utilities, drainage, parking, and safety before construction begins. The conditions reflect requirements from multiple city departments including Engineering, Transportation, and the Fire Department.\n\n## Key Details\nThe property has frontage on three thoroughfares requiring specific improvements:\n- **Pico Boulevard**: 3-foot land dedication plus improvements including 15-foot concrete sidewalk, curb, gutter, and new curb ramp\n- **Arapahoe Street**: 5-foot land dedication plus 12-foot concrete sidewalk and ADA-compliant driveways\n- **Alley (west of Arapahoe)**: 4-foot dedication on both sides to complete a 20-foot right-of-way\n\nAdditional requirements include sewer infrastructure upgrades, parking/driveway design approval, a $205 Department of Transportation fee, and submission of various plans to multiple agencies before permits can be issued.\n\n## Impact\nThis affects the developer/property owner, who must fund and complete all improvements at no expense to the City. Residents benefit from improved streets, sidewalks, drainage, parking safety, and accessibility compliance. No Certificates of Occupancy will be issued until all public improvements are completed to the City Engineer's satisfaction.",

      "summary": "# Summary of CPC-2018-3544: Pico Boulevard Hotel Development\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City Planning Commission is recommending approval of a new 125-room hotel development at 2250-2270 West Pico Boulevard in the Pico Union neighborhood. The project consists of two six-story buildings (76.5 feet tall) separated by an alley, containing 77,828 square feet of floor area. The development would replace an existing 9,627-square-foot market and surface parking lot with underground parking (84 spaces across three subterranean levels).\n\n## Why This Project?\n\nThe site currently has conflicting zoning designations—part is zoned Commercial Manufacturing and part is zoned Low Medium II Residential—making it difficult to develop. The proposed changes would streamline this by unifying the site under a single zoning designation. According to the Council Motion (File 17-0727), this hotel would address Los Angeles's shortage of hotel rooms and provide reasonably priced accommodations west of the 110 Freeway, helping serve visitors to the Convention Center and supporting local economic development in an underdeveloped commercial area.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** Southwest corner of Pico Boulevard and Arapahoe Street\n- **Approvals required:** General Plan Amendment, Zone Change, Height District Change, Conditional Use Permit, and Site Plan Review\n- **Zoning change:** From [Q]C2-1 and RD1.5-1 to C2-2-CPIO\n- **Height:** 76 feet 6 inches (six stories)\n- **Public hearing dates:** January 10, 2024 and March 13, 2025\n- **Applicant:** Min Chun Helen Chen, Da Yuh Development Inc\n\n## Impact\n\nThis project affects South Los Angeles residents and the Pico Union community by converting a vacant market site into a commercial hotel use. The development is expected to generate approximately 409 daily trips (45 in morning peak hour, 19 in evening peak hour). Environmental review found no significant impacts requiring an Environmental Impact Report. Nearby residential properties would see a neighboring commercial hotel use, though traffic studies found no significant impacts at surrounding intersections.",
