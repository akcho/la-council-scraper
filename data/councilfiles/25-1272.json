      "summary": "# Motion Summary: Holodomor Day of Remembrance Funding\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nCouncilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez is proposing to transfer $438 from the Council's Community Services budget to fund a special observation of the Holodomor Day of Remembrance on November 16, 2025. The event will take place at City Hall and include the illumination of City Hall as part of the commemoration.\n\n## Why?\nThe Holodomor Day of Remembrance honors the victims of the Holodomor, the devastating famine in Soviet Ukraine (1932-1933). This motion allows Council District 13 to hold a special observance and ensure City Hall participates in remembering this historical tragedy through symbolic illumination.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Amount:** $438 transferred\n- **Source:** Council District Community Services line item (Fund No. 000713)\n- **Destination:** General Services Fund No. 100-40, Account No. 1100 (Hiring Hall)\n- **Date:** November 16, 2025\n- **Location:** City Hall\n- **Presenter:** Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez (District 13)\n- **Document Date:** October 24, 2025\n\n## Impact\nThis affects Council District 13 residents by allocating modest resources to commemorate an important historical event. The illumination of City Hall demonstrates the city's recognition and respect for those affected by the Holodomor tragedy.",
