      "summary": "# Summary of Council File 25-1188: Santa Monica-Highland Parking Meter Zone Expansion\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Transportation Committee recommends expanding the Santa Monica-Highland Parking Meter Zone (PMZ) in Council District 13 (Hollywood Media District). The expansion would add metered parking to eight additional street segments, including parts of Highland Avenue, Sycamore Avenue, Orange Drive, Mansfield Avenue, Citrus Avenue, Willoughby Avenue, and Romaine Street. The City Attorney is asked to prepare an ordinance to amend the Los Angeles Municipal Code, and the Department of Transportation (LADOT) would install parking meters directly in front of commercial properties in these expanded areas.\n\n## Why?\n\nLADOT conducted parking studies in the Hollywood Media District that demonstrated insufficient parking availability and the need to create better parking turnover in the area. The expansion aims to address parking demand while improving traffic flow through metered parking management.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** Council District 13 (Hollywood Media District)\n- **Committee Vote:** 3 Yes (Hutt, Hernandez, Nazarian), 2 Absent (Park, Padilla)\n- **Cost:** $515,000 initial investment for equipment, signs, stall markings, and red curb installation\n- **Revenue:** Estimated $1.6 million in annual gross revenue, plus additional General Fund revenue from parking citations\n- **Funding Source:** Street Parking Revenue Fund (no impact to General Fund)\n\n## Impact\n\nThis expansion will require visitors and workers in the Hollywood Media District to pay for parking on previously unmetered streets. The metered parking is intended to increase turnover, helping customers access nearby commercial properties more easily. Revenue generated will fund the parking program and potentially support other city services.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Amendment to Santa Monica-Highland Parking Meter Zone\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) is requesting approval to expand the boundaries of the Santa Monica-Highland Parking Meter Zone in Council District 13 (Hollywood Media District). The expansion would add approximately 300 new metered parking spaces across eight additional street segments in the area, including portions of Highland Avenue, Sycamore Avenue, Orange Drive, Mansfield Avenue, Citrus Avenue, Willoughby Avenue, and Romaine Street.\n\n## Why?\nParking studies conducted in October 2022 and October 2024 found that the Hollywood Media District experiences significantly high parking occupancy rates—averaging 88% in the 2024 study, well above LADOT's typical 70-80% target range. This indicates insufficient available parking and increased demand. The expansion aims to improve parking turnover, create better access for customers to nearby businesses, and make enforcement of parking violations easier for traffic officers. Additionally, the area has experienced substantial commercial growth and development over the past decade, driving increased parking demand.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location**: Hollywood Media District bounded by Santa Monica Boulevard, Highland Avenue, Willoughby Avenue, and La Brea Avenue\n- **Estimated Cost**: $515,000 for installation of parking meter equipment, signs, stall markings, and red curbs\n- **Revenue**: Approximately $1.6 million in annual gross revenue, with parking citations generating additional General Fund revenue\n- **Implementation Timeline**: Six months to one year, with installation anticipated by mid-2026\n- **Parking Rate**: $1.50 per hour (existing rate for the Santa Monica-Highland zone)\n- **Community Support**: Letters of support from the Hollywood Media District Business Improvement District, Central Hollywood Neighborhood Council, and Council District 13\n\n## Impact\nThis expansion primarily affects businesses, residents, and visitors in the Hollywood Media District. Residents and business owners benefit from improved parking availability and turnover, making it easier to find street parking near commercial establishments. The Special Parking Revenue Fund will fund the implementation costs, with no impact to the City's General Fund. Revenue generated will support parking management operations and can generate additional General Fund revenue through parking citations.",
