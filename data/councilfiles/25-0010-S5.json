      "summary": "# Summary: Motion for Reward in Connection with June 2, 2024 Shooting Deaths\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Council is being asked to offer a $75,000 reward for information leading to the identification, apprehension, and conviction of the person or persons responsible for a fatal shooting on June 2, 2024. The motion directs the City Clerk to publish notices and advertisements about this reward offer according to city procedures.\n\n## Why?\nOn June 2, 2024, at approximately 12:15 a.m., LAPD officers responded to a shooting at 15th Street and Maple Avenue where a vehicle had been struck by bullets. Two victims were found—Clarence Simpson and Christian Hart—both suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. Despite a full investigation, detectives have been unable to identify the suspects. The motion argues that the responsible person or persons represent an ongoing threat to public safety and that a reward may encourage witnesses to come forward with crucial information.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Incident:** Fatal shooting on June 2, 2024, at 15th Street and Maple Avenue\n- **Victims:** Clarence Simpson and Christian Hart (both killed)\n- **Reward Amount:** $75,000 maximum\n- **Duration:** Six months from the date the reward is advertised\n- **Presented by:** Councilmember Ysabel Jurado (14th District)\n- **Document filed:** October 31, 2025\n\n## Impact\nThis motion affects all Los Angeles residents and visitors by addressing ongoing public safety concerns. If passed, it incentivizes community members with information about the crime to come forward, potentially leading to arrests and convictions while helping bring closure to the victims' families and communities affected by this unsolved violent crime.",
