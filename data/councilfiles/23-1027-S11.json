INSTRUCT the Chief Legislative Analyst (CLA), with the assistance of the City Attorney and DPW, to report on the feasibility of allowing for the use of alternative project delivery methods for City construction projects without the need for approval by ordinance for each individual project and to report with recommendations to effectuate this policy, including a ballot measure for the November 2026 General Election if necessary.
