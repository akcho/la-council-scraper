This amendment would extend the City's partnership with DCLA to develop, promote, and assist with Bureau of Sanitation (BOS) environmental events and programs, with a total cost ceiling of $1.8 million.\n\n## Funding and Financial Impact\nThe $1.8 million commitment is fully funded through the City's 2025-26 Adopted Budget with no additional burden on the General Fund. Funding comes from three sources: $900,000 from the General City Purposes Fund, $450,000 from BOS's Sewer Operations and Maintenance Fund, and $450,000 from the Solid Waste Resources Revenue Fund. All these funds have already been appropriated.\n\n## Committee Action\nThe Energy and Environment Committee unanimously approved this recommendation on October 21, 2025, with all five committee members voting in favor (Nazarian, Yaroslavsky, Jurado, Raman, and Padilla voting YES). The matter now goes to the full City Council for approval.\n\n## Timeline and Significance\nThis is a time-limited file with a deadline of December 16, 2025 (last council action date: December 12, 2025). The partnership aims to support the Bureau of Sanitation's environmental education and community outreach efforts through Discovery Cube Los Angeles's programming and reach.",

This amendment would formalize the Bureau of Sanitation's (BOS) role in developing, promoting, and assisting with environmental events and programs in partnership with DCLA.\n\n## Why?\nThe amendment builds on an existing partnership between the City and DCLA to expand environmental education and programming. The arrangement allows the City to leverage DCLA's resources and expertise in science education while advancing the City's environmental goals through public outreach and community engagement initiatives.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Funding**: $900,000 total contribution split between two sources: $900,000 from the General City Purposes Fund and an additional $900,000 from BOS operational funds ($450,000 from Sewer Operations and Maintenance, $450,000 from Solid Waste Resources Revenue Fund)\n- **Timeline**: Committee approved on November 3, 2023; Council deadline for action is December 15, 2023\n- **No additional General Fund impact** as the $900,000 General Fund contribution was already budgeted for the 2023-24 Adopted Budget\n\n## Impact\nThis partnership expands the City's environmental education reach to Los Angeles residents through DCLA programming while supporting the Bureau of Sanitation's mission. The committee found the proposal complies with City Financial Policies and received Committee approval with four votes in favor and one absence.",
