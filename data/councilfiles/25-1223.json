      "summary": "# Community Impact Statement Summary - Council File 25-1223\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Central Hollywood Neighborhood Council (CHNC) is submitting a Community Impact Statement in **support** of Council File 25-1223, which directs City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto to withdraw her unilateral motion to lift a September 2025 injunction against the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) regarding use of force against journalists.\n\n## Why This Matters?\n\nThe CHNC opposes the City Attorney's attempt to lift the injunction because it was filed without consulting the City Council, the city's elected legislative body, and without public notice or input. A federal judge determined that LAPD engaged in \"unlawful force against members of the media.\" Since June 2025, at least 60 new liability claims have reportedly been filed against LAPD by journalists and protesters alleging further use of force. The CHNC argues that proper procedures and accountability are essential to maintaining public trust.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Vote:** Unanimous (7-0-0) in favor of the position\n- **Date Approved:** October 27, 2025\n- **Judge:** Hernán Vera of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued the original injunction\n- **Liability Claims:** At least 60 new claims filed since June 2025\n\n## Impact\n\nThe CHNC emphasizes that accountability, transparency, and lawful process are fundamental to democratic governance and maintaining public trust in Los Angeles government. The council calls on city leadership to follow established protocols and reaffirm adherence to oversight mechanisms.",

      "summary": "# Summary: City Attorney Request for Closed Session - Los Angeles Press Club v. City of Los Angeles\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Attorney is requesting that the Los Angeles City Council hold a closed (private) session to discuss and receive legal advice regarding pending litigation in the case *Los Angeles Press Club v. City of Los Angeles*. This is a federal lawsuit currently in the U.S. District Court (Case No. 2:25-cv-05423-HDV-E) and has been appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Case No. 25-6331).\n\n## Why?\nThis matter involves \"various incidents involving members of the Los Angeles Police Department during the spring and summer of 2025.\" The City Attorney is seeking private legal counsel with the Council before taking official action on this case. Under California Government Code Section 54956.9(d)(1), the city is permitted to hold closed sessions specifically for conferring with legal counsel about pending litigation, which protects attorney-client privilege and litigation strategy.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Report Date:** October 22, 2025\n- **Case Status:** Active federal litigation with a Ninth Circuit appeal pending\n- **Contact:** Supervising Assistant City Attorney Shaun Dabby Jacobs (213) 978-2704\n- **Affected Parties:** Los Angeles Police Department personnel are copied on the distribution list, suggesting the litigation involves LAPD conduct or policy\n\n## Impact\nThis closed session will allow city leadership to discuss legal strategy and receive attorney advice before making public decisions about how the city will respond to this lawsuit. Once the closed session concludes, the Council's actual decision or action would typically be announced publicly, though the legal deliberations themselves remain confidential.",
