      "summary": "# Summary: Franchise Renewal and Transfer for PS Southern California One, LLC\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Government Operations Committee recommends that the City Council approve a franchise renewal and transfer for PS Southern California One, LLC. The committee is asking the City Attorney to draft an ordinance that would allow this company to continue operating a telecommunications facility in the city's public rights-of-way for a 10-year term.\n\n## Why?\nPS Southern California One, LLC operates an internal telecommunications system that connects two of their own buildings located at 1617 Pontius Avenue and 1606 Cotner Avenue (north of Santa Monica Boulevard). The company uses a city alleyway to run cables for signal transmission between these buildings. This is not a service provided to customers but rather internal infrastructure. The franchise renewal allows the company to continue this established operation under the city's permit system, as governed by City Ordinance No. 184530.\n\n## Key Details\nThe facility consists of six one-inch diameter conduits running through an unnamed city alleyway, containing four video co-axial cables, one intercom co-axial cable, and one keypad shielded cable. The committee considered this matter on October 21, 2025, based on an Information Technology Agency (ITA) report dated July 15, 2025. All three voting councilmembers (Padilla, Lee, and Jurado) voted \"YES\" to recommend approval.\n\n## Financial and Community Impact\nThe city will receive $2,500 in application fees and $450 in annual franchise fees over the 10-year term, totaling $4,500. No community impact statement was submitted regarding this proposal.",

      "summary": "# Summary: PS Southern California One, LLC Franchise Renewal and Transfer\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Information Technology Agency (ITA) recommends that the City Council approve the renewal and transfer of an Information Technology (IT) System franchise from PS Storage, REIT to PS Southern California One, LLC. The ITA also recommends that the City Attorney prepare a draft ordinance granting a 10-year franchise term to allow this renewal and transfer to proceed.\n\n## Why?\n\nAn IT System franchise is an encroachment permit that allows a company to use the City's public rights-of-way (streets and alleys) to run telecommunications infrastructure between two or more points. PS Southern California One, LLC needs this franchise to continue operating a telecommunications facility connecting its buildings at 1617 Pontius Avenue and 1606 Cotner Avenue through an unnamed City alleyway north of Santa Monica Boulevard.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe facility uses six one-inch diameter conduits containing video cables, intercom cables, and keypad cables for signal transmission only—not for serving customers. The franchise is being transferred from the current holder (PS Storage, REIT) to PS Southern California One, LLC. The 10-year term would generate $2,500 in application fees plus $450 in annual franchise fees, totaling $4,500 over the decade.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis approval allows PS Southern California One, LLC to legally maintain its telecommunications infrastructure in City rights-of-way and provides the City with revenue. The project has minimal public impact since it involves internal signal transmission through an existing alleyway and is not a customer-facing service.",
