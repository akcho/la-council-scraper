      "summary": "# Summary: Tiny Home Village Ground Lease Agreement at 5301 Sierra Vista Avenue\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City Council is being asked to authorize the Department of General Services to negotiate and execute a ground lease agreement with GMA – Sierra Vista, LLC and Sierra Vista – Y, LLC to operate a Tiny Home Village at 5301 Sierra Vista Avenue in Council District 13. This is a revised request following renegotiations that updated lease terms since initial Council approval in April 2025.\n\n## Why This Project?\n\nThe Tiny Home Village is designed to provide emergency interim housing for people experiencing homelessness. The City previously allocated $3.87 million in Emergency Stabilization Beds Grant funds for construction of the site, which will include 45 tiny home units providing 51 beds total, plus support facilities like hygiene cabins, laundry facilities, and offices. A nonprofit service provider (to be selected) will operate the housing once construction is complete, with the project expected to open by mid-2027.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe lease runs for five years from January 1, 2026 through December 31, 2030 with no extension options. Rent is waived for the first three months, then increases over time: $20,000/month (April-December 2026), $31,930/month (2027-mid-2028), $32,887.90/month (mid-2028-mid-2029), and $33,874.54/month (mid-2029-end of 2030). Council District 13 discretionary funds will cover the $60,000 lease cost for Fiscal Year 2025-26.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis project directly addresses homelessness in Council District 13 by providing 51 beds of interim housing. The City retains responsibility for major building systems, while the selected operator covers utilities and day-to-day maintenance. There is no immediate General Fund impact for 2025-26, though lease costs for years beyond 2026 may require General Fund support in future budgets.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Tiny Home Village Lease Agreement at Sierra Vista Avenue\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to approve a lease agreement with GMA - Sierra Vista, LLC and Sierra Vista-Y, LLC to operate a Tiny Home Village (THV) at 5301 Sierra Vista Avenue in Council District 13. This interim housing facility would provide 51 beds for homeless individuals and function as a low-barrier navigation center. The lease would be for 36 months with two optional one-year extensions.\n\n## Why?\n\nThis project addresses the city's homelessness crisis as part of the Alliance Settlement Agreement, which requires the city to provide supportive housing. The project is also being fast-tracked through CEQA environmental review exemptions because it qualifies as emergency housing to prevent or mitigate the homelessness emergency.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** 5301 Sierra Vista Avenue, Council District 13\n- **Capacity:** 51 beds\n- **Lease Term:** 3 years with two 1-year renewal options\n- **Operator:** GMA - Sierra Vista, LLC and Sierra Vista-Y, LLC\n- **Contingency:** The lease depends on the nonprofit Dignity Moves executing a contract with the Bureau of Engineering to construct and develop the site\n- **Timeline:** This is a time-limit file with March 5, 2025 deadline (document shows approval occurred April 1, 2025)\n\n## Impact & Fiscal Effects\n\nBoth the Housing and Homelessness Committee and Budget and Finance Committee unanimously approved this proposal. The city will not incur costs through Fiscal Year 2025-26, but will face potential General Fund expenses starting in Fiscal Year 2026-27 to support the lease operations.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Tiny Home Village Lease Agreement at 5301 Sierra Vista Avenue\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City of Los Angeles is seeking approval to negotiate and execute a lease agreement with GMA - Sierra Vista, LLC and Sierra Vista-Y, LLC to operate a Tiny Home Village (THV) at 5301 Sierra Vista Avenue in Council District 13. The facility would provide 51 beds of emergency interim housing for people experiencing homelessness and would count toward the City's obligations under the Alliance Settlement Agreement. The Municipal Facilities Committee approved this recommendation on February 27, 2025, with the condition that the lease is contingent on the full execution of a contract with nonprofit Dignity Moves to construct and build the site.\n\n## Why Is This Needed?\n\nThe Tiny Home Village is part of the City's broader strategy to address homelessness through emergency housing. The project has been previously approved by City Council as part of the Third Alliance Funding report, which allocated $3.86 million in Emergency Stabilization Beds Grant funds to support construction of 45 units (51 beds total) using the Boss Cubez tiny home typology. This lease represents the operational component needed to make the housing site functional.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** 5301 Sierra Vista Avenue, Council District 13 (19,185 square feet)\n- **Capacity:** 51 beds in a mix of single and double occupancy units, plus six hygiene cabins, laundry facilities, offices, and community structures\n- **Lease Terms:** 36 months from commencement with two optional one-year extensions; rent begins at $0 for the first 60 days, then escalates from $2,568/month to $31,000/month by February 2026, with 3% annual increases thereafter\n- **Construction Timeline:** Dignity Moves is expected to complete construction by mid-2026\n\n## Impact\n\nThis decision will provide 51 emergency housing beds for unhoused individuals in CD 13. There is no immediate General Fund impact through Fiscal Year 2025-26, but potential future costs beginning in FY 2026-27 to support ongoing lease payments. The facility includes environmental testing requirements and the City retains the right to terminate the lease if soil testing reveals the site is not viable.",
