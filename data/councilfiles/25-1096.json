      "summary": "# Summary: Closed Session Request for Cesar Chavez 888, LLC Litigation\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Attorney's Office is requesting that the Los Angeles City Council hold a closed (private) session to discuss and receive legal advice regarding pending litigation. The case is **Cesar Chavez 888, LLC v. City of Los Angeles** (Case No. 24STCP01880), currently before the Los Angeles Superior Court.\n\n## Why?\nUnder California Government Code Section 54956.9(d)(1), the City Council is permitted to meet in closed session to consult with legal counsel about ongoing litigation. This allows the city to discuss strategy, legal risks, and advice confidentially without exposing sensitive information that could harm the city's legal position.\n\n## Key Details\nThe litigation involves a **50-unit mixed-use residential project** located at 2115-2125 E. Cesar Chavez Avenue and 301-309 N. Chicago Street in Council District 14 (East Los Angeles). The project includes five Extremely Low-Income units. The case centers on an appeal of a decision made by the East Los Angeles Area Planning Commission regarding a Redevelopment Plan Project Compliance Review for this development. Deputy City Attorney Ernesto Velazquez is the primary contact for this matter.\n\n## Impact\nThis affects residents and stakeholders interested in the proposed development project. A closed session allows city leadership to strategize about the lawsuit away from public view, which is standard practice in pending litigation but limits public transparency during case discussions.",
