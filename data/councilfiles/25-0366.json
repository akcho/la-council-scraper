AUTHORIZE the following: The establishment and appropriation of a new appropriation account entitled BSL – 3D Printing for the Public Right-of-Way, in the amount of $150,000, within the IF No. 105/10, from the available cash balance of the IF. The transfer of $150,000 from the IF No. 105/10, BSL – 3D Printing for the Public Right-of-Way, to Fund No. 100/84 as follows: Fund No. 100/84; Revenue Account No. 008780; Account Name: Street Lighting Improvement and Supplies; Amount: $150,000. INSTRUCT the BSL to: Separately track all encumbrances and expenditures of IF monies so that unspent funds can be returned to the IF at the end of the fiscal year. Report to the Innovation and Performance Commission (IPC): With an accounting of the funds, the lessons learned, and any obstacles faced. If, after the receipt of funds, the scope of the funded item differs from the scope approved for funding by the Mayor and the City Council. Include acknowledgment of the IPC on public materials, as appropriate, such as press releases or websites that reference the 3D Printing for the Public Right-of-Way project. AUTHORIZE the BSL to make technical corrections as necessary to those transactions included in this report to implement Mayor and Council intentions. Fiscal Impact Statement: The CAO reports that the recommendation to note and file this report will have no financial impact. If the Council approves an allocation of $150,000 to the BSL – 3D Printing for the Public Right-of-Way project, it would reduce the remaining IF Balance, which is currently $2,768,922.75. Savings from the IF Balance may be used to address the current city-wide financial crisis and the overspending in the 2024-25 Fiscal Year. Additionally, funding this program may incur unfunded and ongoing costs. Financial Policies Statement: The CAO also reports that the recommendation in this report complies with the City’s Financial Policies. Community Impact Statement: None submitted.

      "summary": "# Summary: Bureau of Street Lighting 3D Printing Project Funding\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Council is being asked to approve $150,000 in funding from the Innovation Fund (IF) to support the Bureau of Street Lighting's (BSL) 3D Printing for the Public Right-of-Way Project. This involves establishing a new appropriation account and transferring the money to the BSL's operational budget for street lighting improvements and supplies.\n\n## Why?\nThe document indicates this is part of the city's innovation initiatives to improve government efficiency. The Government Efficiency, Innovation, and Audits Committee reviewed a City Administrative Officer (CAO) report and determined the project aligns with the city's financial policies. However, the CAO noted this funding may result in unfunded and ongoing costs, and will reduce the available Innovation Fund balance from $2,768,922.75 to approximately $2,618,922.75.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Funding Amount:** $150,000\n- **Source:** Innovation Fund No. 105/10\n- **Committee Vote:** Unanimous approval (Rodriguez, Blumenfield, and Mcosker all voted YES on October 17, 2025)\n- **Requirements:** The BSL must separately track all spending, report to the Innovation and Performance Commission about lessons learned and obstacles, and acknowledge the IPC in public materials related to the project.\n\n## Impact\nThis funding supports street lighting innovation in public right-of-way areas, though the document does not specify the exact nature of the 3D printing application. Any unspent funds must be returned to the Innovation Fund at fiscal year's end. The city notes this allocation reduces available emergency funds during a current citywide financial crisis.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Innovation Fund Recommendation for 3D Printing Project\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City Administrative Officer recommends that the City Council note and file a report regarding LA Lights' Innovation Fund proposal to implement 3D printing technology for producing street lighting fixtures used in public right-of-way installations. The Innovation and Performance Commission (IPC) approved $150,000 in funding for this pilot project, which would involve purchasing two 3D printers to produce between one-quarter and one-half of LA Lights' lighting needs in-house.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nLA Lights faces significantly rising material costs, particularly for electrical system components needed for street lighting connections. By shifting to in-house 3D printing production, the department aims to reduce per-unit costs from $300 to approximately $80—a savings of $220 per unit. LA Lights estimates that if these cost reductions were applied to FY 23/24 purchases, it would have generated nearly $800,000 in savings. The project would also train field staff on new technology and enable faster, customized solutions for addressing vandalism and theft.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **IPC Approval**: $150,000 funding recommended\n- **Cost Reduction**: From $300 per box to $80 per box (73% reduction)\n- **Current Impact**: A 20% increase in basic material costs on existing spending\n- **Innovation Fund Balance**: Currently $2,768,922.75\n\n## Important Note\n\n**This report does NOT recommend approval at this time.** The City Administrative Officer states that despite IPC approval, this Office does not recommend funding the proposal \"as presented at this time\" due to extraordinary budget constraints outlined in the Third Mid-Year Financial Status Report.",
