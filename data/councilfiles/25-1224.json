      "summary": "# Summary: Council File 25-1224\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee is recommending that the City Council approve a new 30-year permit agreement between the Los Angeles Harbor Department and the Los Angeles County Flood Control District. This permit allows the Flood Control District to operate and maintain a storm drain pipeline located at the Port of Los Angeles near Berth 132 in Wilmington.\n\n## Why?\nThis action represents a successor permit to replace an existing agreement. The current permit generates no revenue for the City, but the new permit will establish a fixed annual rental fee, increasing the port's revenue stream. The permit has been determined to be categorically exempt from environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act, meaning no environmental impact study is required.\n\n## Key Details\nThe new permit will increase the fixed minimum annual rent from $0 to **$17,151.75 per year**, effective upon execution. This rental amount will be subject to annual adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index, with a minimum floor of three percent annual increase. The 30-year term provides long-term operational certainty for both the port and the Flood Control District. All revenues generated will be deposited into the Harbor Revenue Fund.\n\n## Impact\nThis change has no negative impact on the City's General Fund. For residents and port operations, it represents increased revenue for harbor maintenance and operations while allowing continued essential storm drain infrastructure maintenance at the port. The committee voted unanimously in favor (3-0) on October 28, 2025.",

This permit allows for the continued operation and maintenance of a storm drain pipeline located near the West Basin at Berth 132 in Wilmington, California.\n\n## Why?\nSuccessor permits are routine authorizations that renew existing operational agreements.

      "summary": "# Summary of Permit No. 968 - LA County Flood Control District\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City of Los Angeles is granting Permit No. 968 to the Los Angeles County Flood Control District for the operation and maintenance of a subsurface stormwater drain system outlet structure (identified as BI-0078) located in the Port of Los Angeles at the Northwest Slip of West Basin. This is a 30-year permit agreement that formalizes the District's right to use and maintain this critical drainage infrastructure.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe BI-0078 storm drain serves a large tributary area of approximately 15,000 acres across nine municipalities (including Carson, Lomita, Los Angeles, Palos Verdes Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills, Rolling Hills Estates, and Torrance). The drain is part of a regional stormwater system regulated under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System Permit. This formal permit ensures coordination among multiple water quality permittees who share responsibility for managing stormwater runoff and water quality compliance.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Permit Area:** 8,405 square feet of subsurface storm drain\n- **Initial Annual Rent:** $17,151.75, subject to annual adjustments (minimum 3% increase annually)\n- **Security Deposit:** $2,859.00\n- **Environmental Fund Deposit:** 1% of Base Rent (up to $100,000 annually)\n- **Term:** 30 years from the effective date\n- **Insurance Requirements:** General liability ($1M), auto liability ($1M), workers' compensation (statutory), and environmental impairment liability ($5M)\n\n## Impact\n\nThis permit affects water quality management across a large portion of South Los Angeles County. It establishes clear operational responsibilities, financial obligations, and environmental compliance requirements for the Flood Control District while protecting the City's interests through rent payments, security deposits, and performance standards. The agreement includes provisions for environmental remediation, maintenance obligations, and restoration requirements to ensure the stormwater system operates safely and effectively.",
