      "summary": "# Summary: Request for Closed Session on Settlement Discussion\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Attorney is requesting that the Los Angeles City Council hold a closed session to discuss and receive legal advice regarding settlement recommendations in a pending lawsuit. This closed session would be held pursuant to California Government Code Section 54956.9(d)(1), which allows local agencies to meet privately with legal counsel to discuss pending litigation.\n\n## Why?\nThe case involves a slip and fall incident that occurred on February 7, 2022, at 7870 Nollan Place in Panorama City. The plaintiff, Jodi Kay Gonda, is suing the City of Los Angeles. The City Attorney's office needs to discuss settlement strategy and receive confidential legal advice with the City Council before making any decisions about how to proceed with the case.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Case Name:** Jodi Kay Gonda v. City of Los Angeles, et al.\n- **Case Number:** LASC Case No. 23VECV02544\n- **Claim Number:** C23-01400\n- **Incident Date:** February 7, 2022\n- **Location:** 7870 Nollan Place, Panorama City, CA 91402\n- **Contact:** Deputy City Attorney Jaime Hernández at (213) 691-1822\n\n## Impact\nThis closed session allows the City Council to discuss litigation strategy confidentially without disclosing the City's legal positions or settlement parameters publicly, which could compromise the City's negotiating position. Residents would not have access to these discussions, as they are protected by attorney-client privilege.",
