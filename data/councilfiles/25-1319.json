REAUTHORIZE the use of up to $1,180,590 in Municipal Improvement Corporation of Los Angeles (MICLA) funding authority provided in the 2019-20 and 2021-22 Adopted budgets that has expired and AUTHORIZE the continued use of funds beyond the City’s MICLA Three-Year Spending Policy for the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure as follows: Fiscal Year (FY): 2019-20, Fund: 298/70, Account: 70S738, Electric Vehicle Chargers – LAPD, Amount: $430,125. FY: 2019-20, Fund: 298/38, Account: 38SEVC, Electric Vehicle Chargers, Amount: $62,997. FY: 2021-22, Fund: 298/40, Account: 40V25F, Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure, Amount: $687,468. AUTHORIZE the CAO to make technical corrections, as necessary, to the transactions authorized through this report, as required to implement the intent of those transactions. Fiscal Impact Statement: The CAO reports that the recommendations stated in this report include transfers, appropriations, and authority for expenditures totaling $21.2 million. This consists of $13.2 million from various special funds, $4.6 million in MICLA, $3.1 million in Grant Funds, and $0.3 million in General Fund within the Capital and Technology Improvement Expenditure Program (CTIEP) program. All transfers and appropriations are based on existing funds, reimbursements, or revenues. There is a potential impact on the General Fund for operations and maintenance costs, with the amount yet to be determined. These costs will be addressed through the City budget process as projects are completed. Financial Policies Statement: The CAO also reports that the recommendations stated in this report comply with the City Financial Policies in that appropriations for funds are limited to available cash balances needed to fund ongoing maintenance, programming, project shortfalls, and critical operational needs in the current budget year. Debt Impact Statement: The CAO further reports that the issuance of MICLA debt is a General Fund obligation. The reauthorization of MICLA funding for the Shell ReCharge Project Closeout (Item X) would cause the City to borrow $1.2 million at an approximate 5.5 percent interest rate over a period of 20 years. The total estimated debt service for the MICLA-funded projects is $2.0 million, including interest of approximately $0.8 million. The estimated average annual debt service is $99,000 over a period of 20 years. Actual interest rates may differ as rates are dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance. We cannot fully predict what interest rates will be in the future. In accordance with the City's Debt Management Policy, the City has an established debt ceiling to guide the evaluation of the affordability for future debt. The debt ceiling for non-voted direct debt as a percentage of General Fund revenues is six percent. The 2025-26 Adopted Budget non-voter-approved debt service ratio is 2.40 percent. The issuance of MICLA debt for these projects will not cause the City to exceed the six percent non-voter-approved debt limit. Community Impact Statement: None submitted.
