      "summary": "# Summary of Council File 22-1025-S1\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to accept $844,694 in grant funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-ED)/CalFresh Healthy Living program from the California Department of Aging. The proposal authorizes the Department of Aging to amend the existing agreement with the state, negotiate updates with local service providers, and make necessary budget adjustments to implement the program.\n\n## Why?\nThe document does not explicitly state the rationale or problem being addressed. However, SNAP-ED programs typically aim to provide nutrition education and healthy living resources to low-income individuals and families receiving SNAP benefits. The grant appears to be funding an expansion or continuation of these services in Los Angeles.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Funding Amount:** $844,694 in grant funds (with no additional cost to the City's General Fund)\n- **Budget Breakdown:** $494,763 for new accounts and $349,931 for increased appropriations within Fund No. 57E (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education)\n- **Fund Transfers:** $83,846 will be transferred from the SNAP-Ed program to cover $68,573 in salaries and $15,273 in office/administrative expenses\n- **Agreement:** Standard Agreement CF-2223-25 will be amended, and service provider agreements will be updated\n- **Committee Vote:** The Civil Rights, Equity, Immigration, Aging and Disability Committee approved the recommendations on October 17, 2025 (4-0, with one member absent)\n\n## Impact\nThis funding will support nutrition education and healthy living services for low-income Los Angeles residents. The budget adjustments allow the Department of Aging to hire staff and cover administrative costs to deliver these services through existing community service providers.",

      "summary": "# Summary: SNAP-Ed/CalFresh Healthy Living Program Funding Amendment\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles Department of Aging (LADOA) is requesting City Council approval to accept an additional **$844,694 in grant funding** from the California Department of Aging (CDA) for the SNAP-Ed/CalFresh Healthy Living program. This would amend the existing contract with the program's main contractor (CNS/RQA/CA, Inc.) and authorize LADOA's General Manager to negotiate amendments with various service providers. The total program funding would increase from the original $718,842 to **$1,563,536**.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe SNAP-Ed/CalFresh Healthy Living program provides evidence-based nutrition education to eligible older adults to help them make healthier food choices on limited budgets and maintain physically active lifestyles. The additional CDA funding will expand this existing program by increasing financial support to the primary contractor and enabling services at Multipurpose Senior Centers (MPCs) citywide. The supplementary funding also supports community garden education, farmers market access initiatives, and intergenerational engagement within Los Angeles neighborhoods.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Funding increase:** $844,694 in new grant funding from CDA\n- **Program extension:** Services continue through June 30, 2026\n- **Total contract value:** $479,626 (including the amendment)\n- **Service locations:** 15 Agency Service Areas (ASAs) citywide, including the Central Business District\n- **Main contractors:** CNS/RQA/CA, Inc. plus eight subcontractors (Jewish Family Service, LGBT Center, St. Barnabas Senior Center, etc.)\n- **Budget allocation:** $710,317 to contractors; $134,377 to LADOA administration and direct services\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects senior citizens throughout Los Angeles who are eligible for SNAP benefits, particularly those 60+ years old seeking nutrition education and healthy lifestyle support. The expansion allows LADOA to provide more comprehensive services across the city's aging population while supporting local community partners and senior centers.",

      "summary": "# Summary: SNAP-ED and CalFresh Grant Funding\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Los Angeles Department of Aging (LADOA) is seeking City Council approval to accept grant funds from California's Department of Aging to support nutrition education programs. Specifically, the city would receive funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-ED) and CalFresh expansion programs for three fiscal years (2022-23 through 2024-25). The council would authorize LADOA to execute agreements with the state and partner agencies that will deliver these nutrition services to residents.\n\n## Why This Matters?\n\nThese grant programs help low-income residents access nutrition education and expand awareness of CalFresh benefits (California's food assistance program). The funding comes from the state at no cost to the City's General Fund, making it an opportunity to expand health and nutrition services without impacting the city budget.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe city would receive **$268,917 annually** for general aging and CalFresh expansion services, plus **$239,614 per year** for SNAP-ED programming provided by Consulting Nutritional Services. The funding covers three fiscal years (October 2022 through September 2025), and LADOA would partner with various public, private, nonprofit, and governmental organizations to deliver services. The Council's Civil Rights, Equity, Immigration, Aging and Disability Committee unanimously approved this recommendation on March 3, 2023.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis funding will support nutrition education programs serving low-income Los Angeles residents, with no additional burden on the city's General Fund. The programs help connect eligible residents with food assistance benefits and improve access to nutritional information.",

      "summary": "# Council File 22-1025: SNAP-Ed and CalFresh Nutrition Assistance Funding\n\n## What is Being Proposed\n\nThe Los Angeles Department of Aging (LADOA) is requesting City Council approval to accept $1.53 million in grant funding from the California Department of Aging over three fiscal years (2022-2025): $718,842 for SNAP-Ed (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education) and $806,751 for CalFresh Healthy Living and Expansion programs. The department also seeks authority to negotiate and execute agreements with service providers to deliver these nutrition education programs.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThese federal nutrition programs aim to improve health outcomes among low-income older adults and people with disabilities in Los Angeles. SNAP-Ed provides evidence-based nutrition education to promote healthy food choices and prevent chronic diseases, while CalFresh Expansion increases access to federal food assistance benefits. LADOA, as an Area Agency on Aging, is uniquely positioned to reach seniors and address barriers to program participation among vulnerable populations.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe funding breaks down as $239,614 annually for SNAP-Ed services and $268,917 annually for CalFresh Expansion, running through September 30, 2025. Consulting Nutritional Services will provide SNAP-Ed nutrition education at congregate meal sites, while three organizations—ONEgeneration Senior Enrichment Center, Mexican American Opportunity Foundation, and VIC-Bernardi Multipurpose Senior Center—will deliver CalFresh services, each receiving $80,675 annually.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis proposal has no negative fiscal impact on the City General Fund, as it relies entirely on state and federal grant money. It will expand nutrition education and food assistance access for eligible low-income seniors and adults with disabilities across Los Angeles, helping reduce food insecurity and improve health outcomes in the community.",
