      "summary": "# Summary: File No. 23-0100 - POLA and LAWA Sustainability Coordination Report\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council receive and file a joint report from the Port of Los Angeles (POLA) and Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) dated August 4, 2025. The report addresses information sharing practices and interdepartmental coordination related to sustainability initiatives between these two major city departments.\n\n## Why?\nThe committee sought to assess how effectively POLA and LAWA are coordinating with each other and sharing information on sustainability efforts. This review is part of broader city oversight to ensure these key transportation infrastructure agencies are aligned on environmental and sustainability goals and working collaboratively rather than in silos.\n\n## Key Details\nThe Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee held a public hearing on October 14, 2025, where they received public comment on the joint report. All three committee members (Park, McOsker, and Rodriguez) voted unanimously in favor of receiving and filing the report. No fiscal impact is associated with this action, and no community impact statement was submitted.\n\n## Impact\nThis action has minimal immediate impact on residents since the committee determined no further council action is needed at this time. However, the report itself may inform future coordination efforts between the Port and Airports on sustainability initiatives, potentially affecting environmental outcomes at Los Angeles's two largest transportation hubs.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Joint POLA-LAWA Sustainability Collaboration Report\n\n## What Is Being Reported\n\nThe Port of Los Angeles (POLA) and Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) have submitted a joint response to Motion 23-0100, which requested both departments report on their information-sharing practices and coordination related to sustainability and environmental initiatives. Rather than proposing a new action, this document describes existing and planned collaborative efforts between the two city departments.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nBoth POLA and LAWA are major transportation hubs with significant environmental responsibilities. They face a unique challenge: reducing emissions not only from their own operations but also from tenant-operated equipment (cargo handlers at the port, ground support equipment at the airport) over which they have limited direct control. By sharing knowledge and coordinating strategies, the departments can more effectively address environmental goals and navigate complex regulatory requirements from federal, state, and local agencies.\n\n## Key Collaboration Areas\n\nThe report highlights several existing initiatives: participation in the Mayor's Climate Cabinet and Departmental Chief Sustainability Officers meetings; technology advancement discussions (including ship emission reduction systems, alternative fuels, and energy upgrades); residential noise mitigation programs; zero waste implementation; and regulatory cooperation. A notable example is LAWA's 2019 Memorandum of Understanding with the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which POLA is now pursuing for the port to address emissions from tenant-operated equipment.\n\n## Future Impact\n\nGoing forward, POLA and LAWA plan to expand collaboration through in-person expert exchanges and joint initiatives on zero waste, low-carbon fuels infrastructure, zero-emission vehicles, and technology development. These partnerships could lead to more coordinated environmental policies, cost efficiencies, and improved air quality for communities near both facilities.",

      "summary": "# Summary of Council File 23-0100\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Trade, Travel, and Tourism Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council instruct two major city agencies—the Port of Los Angeles and Los Angeles World Airports—to submit a report on their sustainability practices and information-sharing efforts.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe motion, sponsored by Council Members McOsker and Yaroslavsky, seeks to improve coordination and transparency around sustainability initiatives across Los Angeles's major transportation hubs. By requiring these agencies to report on their practices, the city aims to identify best practices, share lessons learned, and ensure regional sustainability efforts are coordinated rather than siloed.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe report should address: (1) emerging sustainability technologies and policies being used; (2) lessons learned about the effectiveness of current initiatives; and (3) how these agencies coordinate with other regional sustainability efforts. The committee unanimously approved the motion on February 7, 2023, with all three members voting yes. Notably, neither the City Administrative Officer nor the Chief Legislative Analyst has completed a financial analysis, and no community impact statement was submitted.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects Los Angeles residents by potentially improving air quality, reducing emissions, and advancing climate goals at two critical transportation hubs. The report will help the city understand how well these agencies are working together and inform future sustainability policy decisions across the region.",
