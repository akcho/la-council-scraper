      "summary": "# Summary: L-Shaped Alley Vacation - Council File 13-0347-S1\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Council is being asked to formally adopt a Resolution to Vacate (No. 25-1401355) for an L-shaped alley located northerly of Olympic Boulevard and westerly of Mateo Street in Council District 14. This action follows up on a June 25, 2024 City Council meeting where the initial decision was made and no protests were filed against the vacation.\n\n## Why?\nThe vacation is proceeding as originally authorized by the City Council in June 2024. The document indicates that all conditions from that earlier action have been fulfilled, and the formal resolution is now being presented to finalize the vacation process. The Bureau of Engineering is using an accelerated review process to move this through to completion.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Project ID:** VAC-E1401355\n- **Original Council Action:** June 25, 2024 (Council File No. 13-0347-S1)\n- **Current Date:** October 21, 2025\n- **Location:** Council District 14 (South Los Angeles area)\n- **Environmental Status:** Exempt from California Environmental Quality Act under categorical exemptions (Class 5(3))\n- **Legal Compliance:** Complies with Los Angeles City Charter Section 556 and the General Plan\n\n## Impact\nThis vacation allows the city to relinquish public right-of-way in this alley, likely enabling adjacent property owners to gain control or use of the space. No public protests were filed during the comment period, suggesting minimal community opposition.",

The Public Works Committee voted unanimously (3-0) on May 22, 2024, to recommend approval of this street vacation.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe petitioner has requested this vacation to acquire the alley land for developing a residential building. The city determined there is a public benefit to vacating this street, as it would relieve the city of ongoing maintenance obligations and eliminate potential liability associated with owning and maintaining the alley easement.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **File Number:** VAC-E1401355\n- **Investigation Fee:** The petitioner has already paid $14,980 for the city's investigation, with any cost overages to be charged to the petitioner\n- **Environmental Status:** The vacation is exempt from California Environmental Quality Act review under the city's categorical exemption guidelines\n- **Compliance:** The vacation meets California Streets and Highways Code requirements, is not needed for non-motorized transportation, and is not necessary for present or future public use\n- **Committee Vote:** All three members (Lee, Blumenfield, Padilla) voted \"Yes\"\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects property owners and residents in the area seeking development. The city saves money on maintenance while transferring the vacated land to the developer. The document notes no community impact statement was submitted.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Street Vacation Request for L-Shaped Alley (Council File 13-0347-S1)\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Engineer is recommending that Los Angeles vacate (officially close and remove from public ownership) an L-shaped public alley located north of Olympic Boulevard and west of Mateo Street in Council District 14. This would transfer the alley land to the adjacent private property owners. The petition for this vacation was filed on January 22, 2019, and the City Council initiated the vacation process on March 19, 2019.\n\n## Why?\nThe property owner (represented by David Evans and Associates) wants to vacate the alley to develop a residential building on the combined property. The City Engineer determined this vacation serves a public benefit because: (1) the City will no longer need to maintain the alley, (2) the City will be relieved of potential liability issues, and (3) the alley is unnecessary for public use. No objections were received, and three city departments (Transportation, Fire, and Planning) stated they have no objection. A temporary alley closure is already in effect at this location.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** L-shaped alley north of Olympic Boulevard, west of Mateo Street (Central City North area, zoned for heavy manufacturing)\n- **Petitioner:** Taylor Miller of David Evans and Associates, representing the property owners\n- **Deposit:** The petitioner has paid $14,980 for investigation costs\n- **Conditions:** The petitioner must complete 11 conditions within 2 years, including sidewalk/curb repairs on Mateo Street, utility easement arrangements, and securing consents from adjoining property owners and Caltrans\n- **Required Improvements:** Repair and replace damaged sidewalk, curb, and gutter along Mateo Street; fill in parkway area with concrete\n\n## Impact\nThis vacation primarily benefits the property developer by expanding their usable land for residential development. Residents will not be significantly impacted since the alley is already temporarily closed and is not needed for pedestrian, bicycle, or vehicle circulation. The neighboring property owners must consent to the vacation, and utility companies must either remove their facilities or secure easement rights to keep them in place.",

This follows an application submitted by David Evans and Associates on January 22, 2019. The document recommends that the Bureau of Engineering investigate the feasibility of this vacation and, if approved by the Public Works and Gang Reduction Committee, schedule it for full City Council consideration with a required public hearing.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe petitioner, David Evans and Associates, wants to vacate this alley so they can utilize the space to serve existing adjacent properties. The alley is no longer needed as public right-of-way, and vacating it would allow the petitioner to incorporate it into their private development or property use.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Petition fee paid**: $14,980.00 by the petitioner to cover investigation costs\n- **File reference**: VAC E1401355, Council District 14\n- **Date of report**: February 13, 2019\n- **Legal basis**: California Streets and Highways Code, Division 9, Part 3\n- **Next steps**: Bureau of Engineering feasibility study, followed by committee review and public hearing before Council consideration\n\n## Impact\n\nThis process is preliminary and does not constitute approval—it only initiates the investigation phase. If approved, the vacation would remove public access to this alley and transfer it to private control, potentially affecting nearby residents or businesses. The public hearing requirement ensures community input before any final decision.",
