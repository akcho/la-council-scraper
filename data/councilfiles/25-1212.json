      "summary": "# Summary of Council File 25-1212\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Arts, Parks, Libraries, and Community Enrichment Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council approve an agreement with Volunteers of America of Los Angeles to operate a Head Start preschool program in a city-owned building at Valley Plaza Park in North Hollywood. The organization would have exclusive use of a stand-alone building located at 12331 Vanowen Street for this purpose.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nHead Start is a federal program that provides early childhood education and services to low-income families. By partnering with Volunteers of America, the City is expanding access to quality preschool services in the North Hollywood area without requiring city funding. The program is self-sustaining, meaning the organization covers all operational and program costs through other funding sources.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** 12331 Vanowen Street, North Hollywood, CA 91606 (Valley Plaza Park)\n- **Partner Organization:** Volunteers of America of Los Angeles\n- **Committee Vote:** Approved 2-1 (Jurado and Hernandez voted yes; Nazarian was absent)\n- **Fiscal Impact:** No cost to the city's General Fund\n- **Environmental Review:** Determined to be categorically exempt from California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requirements\n- **Filing Fee:** $75 for Notice of Exemption\n\n## Impact\n\nThis agreement will provide early childhood education services to families in North Hollywood with no negative impact on the city budget. The community gains increased access to Head Start programming, while the city maintains oversight through an agreement with a qualified nonprofit organization.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Valley Plaza Park Head Start Preschool Program Agreement\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Council is being asked to authorize a formal five-year agreement between the Department of Recreation and Parks (RAP) and Volunteers of America of Los Angeles (VOALA) to operate the \"Little Steps Head Start\" preschool program at Valley Plaza Park in North Hollywood. This would replace the current temporary permit that expires January 28, 2026, with a more permanent arrangement that includes an option to renew for an additional five years.\n\n## Why?\nVOALA has been operating this Head Start program since the 1990s and has been using the park facility under a temporary, revocable permit. The formalization of the agreement is intended to provide stability for the program while ensuring it continues to serve low-income families in the San Fernando Valley. The program provides early childhood education, health services, mental health support, and nutrition assistance to children ages 2-5 whose parents meet federal poverty guidelines, operating at no cost to the City.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** 12331 Vanowen Street, North Hollywood\n- **Program capacity:** Up to 40 children (currently 24 enrolled)\n- **Operating hours:** August through June, Monday-Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n- **Cost to City:** None—VOALA covers all operational costs and pays RAP $1,704 annually in cost recovery fees (staff impact, administrative services, common area maintenance)\n- **Enrollment:** At least 10% reserved for children with disabilities\n\n## Impact\nThis agreement benefits low-income families in North Hollywood by ensuring continued access to free, high-quality early childhood education and comprehensive support services. The program poses no fiscal burden to the City since VOALA is self-sustaining through federal Head Start funding. The City Council's approval would provide the organization with the certainty needed to maintain long-term program stability and planning.",
