After allowing for public comment, the committee voted to approve the recommendation, with two members voting yes (Jurado and Hernandez) and one member absent (Nazarian). The current board composition will include 2 male and 3 female members, achieving gender balance on the commission.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis reappointment ensures continued representation on a commission that serves the Native American Indian community in Los Angeles. The matter is now forwarded to the full City Council for final approval. The document notes it is \"not official until Council acts,\" meaning the reappointment becomes final only after the full Council votes on it.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Reappointment of Vivian Garcia to Native American Indian Commission\n\n## What is Being Proposed\nMayor Karen Bass is requesting City Council confirmation to reappoint Vivian Garcia to the Los Angeles City-County Native American Indian Commission for a four-year term ending October 7, 2029. This is a reappointment, as Ms. Garcia's current term expires on October 7, 2025.\n\n## Why\nThe Mayor certifies that Ms. Garcia is \"especially qualified by reason of training and experience\" for this position and that the appointment is made \"solely in the interest of the City.\" Garcia brings significant expertise in tribal relations, community outreach, and serving Los Angeles's urban Native American population.\n\n## Key Details\nMs. Garcia is a proud Cherokee citizen and current Tribal & Community Liaison for United American Indian Involvement (UAII). She holds a Master's degree in Early Childhood Education and a Bachelor's degree in American Indian Studies from UCLA. Her professional background includes direct services to vulnerable children and families, care coordination, and community advocacy. The Commission currently has five members, all identifying as Native American, representing different City Council districts and regions.\n\n## Impact\nThis reappointment maintains continuity on the commission that advises the City on Native American Indian matters and policy. The confirmation process requires Ms. Garcia to complete background checks, meet with Councilmembers, and appear at committee and full Council hearings before final approval. Commission Affairs staff will support her through the confirmation timeline.",

Garcia would serve a term ending October 7, 2025, filling a vacancy left by Joseph Quintana's departure.\n\n## Background and Rationale\n\nThe committee reviewed the Mayor's appointment recommendation on June 5, 2024, which was originally submitted on May 20, 2024. The appointment aims to fill an open seat on the Native American Indian Commission, which advises the city and county on matters affecting Native American communities in Los Angeles.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Appointee:** Vivian Garcia\n- **Commission:** Los Angeles City/County Native American Indian Commission\n- **Term End Date:** October 7, 2025\n- **Current Board Composition:** 1 male member, 2 female members, and 2 vacant seats\n- **Committee Vote:** Unanimous approval (Hernandez, Lee, and Hutt all voted YES)\n- **Status:** Background check is pending; no financial disclosure statement is required\n\n## Impact\n\nThis appointment would help ensure the Native American Indian Commission has adequate representation to fulfill its advisory role. With Garcia's appointment, the board would have 4 members instead of 3, bringing it closer to full capacity and strengthening its ability to serve Los Angeles's Native American community.",

The appointment is subject to City Council confirmation and will fill the vacancy left by Joseph Quintana's departure.\n\n## Why This Appointment\nThe Mayor certifies that Garcia is \"especially qualified by reason of training and experience\" for the position. Garcia brings relevant credentials including a Master's degree in Early Childhood Education and a Bachelor's degree in American Indian Studies from UCLA. She currently serves as Tribal & Community Liaison for United American Indian Involvement (UAII), where she develops partnerships with tribal governments and community organizations serving the Native American population in Los Angeles County. She is also an active council member for Tsa-La-Gi LA (Cherokees of Los Angeles), an official Cherokee Nation affiliate, and is a proud Cherokee citizen with deep community roots.\n\n## Key Details\nGarcia has direct experience advocating for the underserved Urban Indian population through roles including In-Home Outreach Counselor at the Southern California Indian Center (2018-2019), Care Coordinator at UAII (2019-2020), and her current position since October 2020. Before Council confirmation, she must complete several requirements within one week: submit a Remuneration Form and two undated Separation Letters, schedule a fingerprinting appointment for a background check, and potentially meet with her City Councilmember and Committee Chair.\n\n## Impact\nThis appointment strengthens the Commission's representation of the Native American community with a professional who has direct experience serving vulnerable populations and building tribal relationships. The appointment requires City Council confirmation and will be reviewed by the Neighborhoods and Community Enrichment Committee before a full Council vote.",
