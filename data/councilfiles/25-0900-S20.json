      "summary": "# Summary: Thatcher Avenue & Washington Boulevard Lighting District Ordinance\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Council is being asked to approve a special assessment ordinance that will levy fees on properties within the Thatcher Avenue & Washington Boulevard Lighting District to fund street lighting maintenance and electric service for a 12-month period ending June 30, 2025. This ordinance confirms and approves assessments previously adopted by the Board of Public Works and authorizes the Board to proceed with purchasing and maintaining the necessary lighting equipment.\n\n## Why?\nThis ordinance is required under California law (Proposition 218 and Government Code Section 53753) to formally confirm special assessments on benefiting properties. The lighting district was established through an earlier ordinance of intention (Ordinance No. 188637), and this ordinance completes the legal process by formally approving the assessment roll and authorizing implementation of the lighting improvements.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Service Period:** 12 months ending June 30, 2025\n- **Location:** Thatcher Avenue & Washington Boulevard area\n- **Legal Basis:** Los Angeles Administrative Code Sections 6.95-6.127, California Government Code Section 53753, and Proposition 218\n- **File Number:** 25-0900-S20\n- **Responsible Agency:** Board of Public Works (authorized to issue purchase orders for equipment and services)\n\n## Impact\nProperty owners within the designated lighting district will be assessed fees to cover the cost of maintaining electroliers (street lights) and providing electric current. This is a special assessment that applies only to properties deemed to benefit from improved street lighting in this specific area.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Thatcher Avenue and Washington Boulevard Lighting District Assessment\n\n## What is Being Proposed\nThe Los Angeles City Clerk is recommending that the City Council approve the establishment of a new Street Lighting Maintenance Assessment District for the Thatcher Avenue and Washington Boulevard area. This would authorize the city to impose annual maintenance assessments on property owners in the district to fund ongoing lighting system upkeep.\n\n## Why This Matters\nUnder Proposition 218 (a California voter-approved measure), special assessments like this must be approved by property owners through a weighted ballot process—meaning each owner's vote carries weight proportional to their proposed assessment amount. The city conducted this ballot process, and the results showed majority support for the assessment.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Ballot Results**: 29 property owners submitted ballots by the August 12, 2025 deadline\n- **Support Level**: 60.49% of the weighted assessment value voted \"yes\" ($2,198.59), compared to 39.51% voting \"no\" ($1,435.98)\n- **District Coverage**: 61 total parcels are included in the proposed district, with total proposed assessments of $11,701.24\n- **Next Steps**: The City Clerk is recommending the Council deny any protests, confirm the assessments, and adopt an ordinance levying the assessments\n\n## Impact\nProperty owners in this Thatcher Avenue and Washington Boulevard area will be subject to annual maintenance assessments for street lighting. The weighted majority approval means the assessment will move forward.",

      "summary": "# Summary of Ordinance No. 188637\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City of Los Angeles is establishing a new street lighting district called the **Thatcher Avenue & Washington Boulevard Lighting District** to operate, maintain, repair, and provide electric energy for street lights in fiscal year 2024-2025. The district covers lighting on Thatcher Avenue (from Washington Boulevard to Harbor Crossing Lane), Howard Street, Dickson Street, Burrell Street, Berkeley Drive, and Washington Boulevard in a specified area.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe City Council has determined that street lighting improvements are in the public interest and convenience for this area. The ordinance follows the established legal framework under the Los Angeles Administrative Code, California Government Code, and Proposition 218, which allows cities to create special assessment districts where property owners in a benefiting area share the costs of infrastructure improvements based on the benefit they receive.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Fiscal Year:** 2024-2025\n- **Public Hearing:** August 12, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. in the Council Chamber\n- **Assessment Method:** Property owners in the district will be assessed based on proportional financial obligation outlined in an Engineer's Report\n- **Ballot Process:** Property owners vote on the assessment using weighted ballots (voting power proportional to their financial obligation)\n- **Annual Increases:** Assessments may increase annually by no more than the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n- **Conditions:** Assessments only transfer to property tax rolls if the lighting system is energized by July 1, 2024\n\n## Impact\n\nAffected property owners within the district boundaries will receive notices and ballots. They may file written protests or attend the public hearing to voice concerns. If weighted \"yes\" votes equal or exceed weighted \"no\" votes, the Council will impose the assessment and construct the lighting system. If \"no\" votes prevail, the assessment will not be levied and the lighting system will not be constructed or will be removed from service. Property owners will be responsible for ongoing maintenance costs through annual assessments.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Thatcher Avenue & Washington Boulevard Street Lighting Maintenance Assessment District\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Bureau of Street Lighting is proposing to establish a new street lighting maintenance assessment district for Thatcher Avenue and Washington Boulevard in Marina del Rey (Council District 11). The City Council is being asked to adopt an \"Ordinance of Intention\" that would initiate a formal assessment process for 29 streetlights serving 61 properties in this area. The total annual assessment would be $11,701.24 for the 2024-2025 fiscal year.\n\n## Why This is Needed?\n\nThe proposed streetlights are part of an \"AHSC Housing Safety Improvement Project.\" Rather than funding street lighting maintenance through general city tax revenue, Los Angeles policy requires that properties receiving \"special benefit\" from lighting systems pay for their operation and maintenance directly through assessments. According to Proposition 218 (a state constitutional requirement), property owners must vote to approve such assessments before they can be levied.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe assessment covers streets including Thatcher Avenue (from Washington Boulevard to Harbor Crossing Lane), Washington Boulevard, Howard Street, Dickson Street, Burrell Street, and Berkeley Drive. Individual property assessments range from approximately $73.78 to $2,459.25 annually, calculated based on land use type, property size, and proximity to lighting. Residential properties pay lower rates than commercial properties. Property owners will receive formal ballots and have the opportunity to file written protests at a public hearing before the Council decides whether to finalize the assessments.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe 61 affected property owners in the Marina del Rey area will be responsible for funding all operation, maintenance, and eventual replacement costs of the new streetlights if the assessment is approved. A majority weighted vote in favor is required to proceed. If property owners vote against it (by weighted financial obligation), the lighting system will not be constructed or will be removed from service.",
