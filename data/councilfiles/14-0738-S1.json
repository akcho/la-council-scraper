      "recommendation": "DETERMINE that the DWP’s amendments to the OATT is exempt pursuant to California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines 15060(c)(3). In accordance with this section, an activity is not subject to CEQA if it does not meet the definition of a project. Section 15378(b)(4) states that government fiscal activities which do not involve any commitment to any specific project which may result in a potentially significant physical impact on the environment do not meet that definition. Therefore, the amendment to an agreement to change the terms of the agreement is not subject to CEQA. APPROVE the DWP Resolution and General Manager and Chief Engineer's Supplemental Certificates authorizing Amendments No. 5 and No. 6 to the OATT, DWP No. BP 01-017. APPROVE delegation of authority to the Board of Water and Power Commissioners (Board) by approval of an amendment to Section 23.133(a) of the Los Angeles Administrative Code (LAAC) authorizing the Board to delegate to the General Manager the authority to enter into such transmission service agreements pursuant to the OATT. AUTHORIZE, upon proper certification, the Chief Accounting Employee, DWP, to draw demands on the Power Revenue Fund, in accordance with the terms of this Amendment. PRESENT and ADOPT the accompanying ORDINANCE dated October 7, 2025, amending Section 23.133 of Article 3, Chapter 7, Division 23 of the LAAC approving the DWP OATT and providing the Board the authority to enter into agreements for interconnecting electric generating facilities to the DWP Transmission System. Fiscal Impact Statement: The City Administrative Officer reports that there is no impact on the General Fund. Proposed Amendments No. 5 and No. 6, to the DWP OATT, DWP BP-017, modify only existing non-rate terms and conditions relating to the provisioning of transmission and ancillary services and do not impact the tariff revenue to the Power Revenue Fund. The proposed recommendations comply with the DWP’s Financial Policies.

      "summary": "# Summary of Council File 14-0738-S1\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Energy and Environment Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council approve amendments to the Department of Water and Power's (DWP) Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT). The proposal includes approving two specific amendments (Amendments No. 5 and No. 6) to the transmission tariff agreement and granting the Board of Water and Power Commissioners authority to delegate certain transmission service agreements to the General Manager.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe amendments modify existing terms and conditions for how the DWP provisions transmission and ancillary services to electric generating facilities connecting to the DWP transmission system. According to the fiscal impact statement, these changes do not affect rates or tariff revenue—they only adjust non-rate operational terms and conditions. The City Administrative Officer confirmed there is no impact on the General Fund.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- The committee met on October 21, 2025, and voted unanimously (5-0) to approve the recommendations\n- The ordinance amends Section 23.133 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code\n- A CEQA exemption determination was made, finding these administrative/fiscal activities do not constitute a \"project\" requiring environmental review\n- The last day for Council action is November 14, 2025, with a final deadline of November 30, 2025\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change primarily affects businesses and entities seeking to interconnect electric generating facilities to the DWP's transmission system. By streamlining the approval process through delegation authority, the city can more efficiently manage transmission service agreements while maintaining oversight through policy parameters.",

      "summary": "# Summary: LADWP Transmission Tariff Amendment\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe City Attorney's Office is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council adopt a draft ordinance amending the Los Angeles Administrative Code to expand the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's (LADWP) authority to enter into transmission service agreements. Specifically, the amendment would allow LADWP's General Manager to execute agreements with longer terms and under different conditions than currently permitted, including two-year terms with automatic renewal options and terms exceeding three years under specific circumstances.\n\n## Why?\n\nCurrently, LADWP can only execute transmission service agreements for periods not exceeding three years. The proposed amendment seeks to modernize and streamline LADWP's ability to manage its transmission system capacity and generate revenue from excess capacity. This change also updates LADWP's Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) to comply with operational requirements and standards set by regional electricity coordinators and the City Charter, while ensuring comparable and non-discriminatory service to all qualified customers.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe ordinance would authorize three new agreement types: (1) two-year terms with automatic renewal options for additional two-year periods, provided LADWP retains sole discretion to terminate and the agreements don't jeopardize the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds; (2) terms exceeding three years under an executed Governmental Person Use Certificate; and (3) agreements pursuant to an approved transmission service tariff. The amended OATT includes standard procedures for interconnecting both large (greater than 20 megawatts) and small (20 megawatts or less) electric generating facilities to LADWP's grid.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change affects electricity generators seeking to connect to LADWP's transmission system and allows LADWP greater flexibility in revenue generation from excess transmission capacity. The Board of Water and Power Commissioners is requesting Council adoption of the ordinance. Council members should note the City Attorney has determined the amendment is exempt from California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review as it involves a fiscal/administrative change without commitment to a specific project.",

      "summary": "# Summary: LADWP Open Access Transmission Tariff Amendments\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) is requesting City Council approval of two amendments to its Open Access Transmission Tariff (Amendment No. 5 and Amendment No. 6, identified as DWP No. BP 01-017).
