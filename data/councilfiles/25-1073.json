      "summary": "# Summary of Council File 25-1073\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Civil Rights, Equity, Immigration, Aging, and Disability Committee is recommending that the Los Angeles City Council transfer $326,177.75 in funding to support improvements at the Pacoima Little League Facility. Specifically, the funds would be redirected from an account designated for \"Carl St GAP Closures\" to an account for \"Pacoima Little League Shade Structures.\"\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe motion was introduced by Council Members Rodriguez and Soto-Martínez and was considered at a committee meeting on October 17, 2025. The funds come from the Community Development Trust Fund (Fund No. 424). The Community Investment for Families Department (CIFD) has been authorized to oversee the transfer and work with the Department of Recreation and Parks to execute the project. The committee voted 4-1 in favor (with Rodriguez absent and Padilla, Nazarian, and Jurado supporting the motion alongside Soto-Martínez).\n\n## Impact\n\nThis funding will directly benefit residents of Pacoima by enhancing recreational facilities available to the community, particularly for youth participating in Little League. The shade structures are expected to improve conditions at the facility, likely providing relief during hot weather for young athletes and their families.\n\n## Important Note\n\nThis report is not official until the full City Council votes on the matter. Additionally, neither the City Administrative Officer nor the Chief Legislative Analyst has completed a financial analysis of this proposal.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Pacoima Little League Facility Improvements Motion\n\n## What Is Being Proposed?\n\nCouncilmember Monica Rodriguez is proposing to transfer $326,177.75 in remaining Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds from a completed Carl Street Gap Closure project to fund additional improvements at the Pacoima Little League facility located at 11000 Dronfield Avenue in Council District 7.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe Carl Street Gap Closure project (funded under a prior budget cycle) was recently completed ahead of schedule. Rather than let the remaining CDBG funds go unused, the motion redirects these funds to benefit the Pacoima Little League—a facility that serves a low-to-moderate income community. The motion also supports the Department of Recreation and Parks' planned construction of shade structures at the site, which was originally allocated funding in the current fiscal year budget.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Amount:** $326,177.75 in remaining CDBG funds\n- **Location:** Pacoima Little League, 11000 Dronfield Avenue, Council District 7\n- **Funding source:** Community Development Trust Fund (remaining from Carl Street Gap Closure project)\n- **Project scope:** Shade structures and additional facility improvements\n- **Authority:** The Community Investment for Families Department (CIFD) is authorized to process documents and execute payments with City Attorney approval\n\n## Impact\n\nThis benefits the local low-to-moderate income community by improving recreational facilities for youth. The reallocation maximizes use of available public funds without requiring new budget allocations.",
