      "summary": "# Summary: Request for Closed Session on Litigation Settlement\n\n## What is Being Proposed\nThe City Attorney's Office is requesting that the Los Angeles City Council hold a **closed session discussion** with legal counsel to discuss settlement negotiations in a pending lawsuit. The closed session would be held pursuant to California Government Code Section 54956.9(d)(1), which allows confidential discussions about litigation matters.\n\n## Why and Background\nThis matter concerns a **trip and fall incident that occurred on August 21, 2022**, at a raised sidewalk located at 13350 Sherman Way in North Hollywood. The litigation involves multiple plaintiffs (led by Lawrence Craig Deutsch) suing the City of Los Angeles. The case is identified as LASC Case No. 23BBCV01593, with associated claim numbers C23-66873 and C23-66874.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Incident Date:** August 21, 2022\n- **Location:** 13350 Sherman Way, North Hollywood\n- **Case Number:** 23BBCV01593\n- **Contact:** Karen Woodward, Managing Assistant City Attorney, (310) 948-9457\n- The Board of Public Works Commission has been copied on this communication, indicating their involvement in the matter\n\n## Impact\nThis affects City resources and liability exposure related to sidewalk maintenance and premises liability. The closed session will allow the City Council and legal counsel to confidentially discuss settlement strategy without public disclosure, which is standard in active litigation proceedings.",
