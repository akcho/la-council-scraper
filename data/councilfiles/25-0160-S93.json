      "summary": "# Summary: Building and Safety Lien Notice for Code Violations\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThe Department of Building and Safety is requesting that the City Council authorize a lien to be recorded against the property at **6080 West Alcott Street, Los Angeles** (APN: 5068-003-053) for a total of **$1,276.56**. This lien covers code violation inspection fees and related charges assessed against the property owner for failing to comply with city building codes.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe property was inspected and found to be in violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Code. On December 5, 2022, the property owner was issued an order to correct violations including open storage of inoperable vehicles in the driveway and side yards, as well as open storage of auto parts, furniture, and debris. As of the date of this report, the owner had not achieved compliance. The department is seeking to record a lien as a mechanism to ensure payment of inspection and administrative fees while incentivizing compliance with the order.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Property Owner**: Marvin Collins, Trustee of Melvin L. Gibson Deceased Trust\n- **Violations**: Open storage of inoperable vehicles and materials in required yards (Code Sections 12.21A.1(a), 12.21C.1(g), 12.03, and 91.8902)\n- **Original Compliance Deadline**: January 4, 2023 (not met)\n- **Fees Assessed**: Code violation investigation fee ($336), system development surcharge ($20.16), late charge/collection fee ($840), system development surcharge late fee ($50.40), and title report fee ($30)\n- **Current Property Value**: $1,893,528\n\n## Impact\n\nThe property owner will have a lien recorded against their property until the fees are paid. This affects the property's title and could impact future sales, refinancing, or other transactions involving the property. The owner remains responsible for correcting the underlying code violations and may face additional penalties, including potential vacation of the building, if violations persist.",
