      "summary": "# Summary: McKinley Place Street Vacation - Council File 11-0122-S3\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe City Council is being asked to formally adopt a Resolution to Vacate (Resolution No. 25-1401340) for a portion of McKinley Place located southerly of 87th Street in Council District 9. This action follows up on a previous City Council decision from September 22, 2020, and implements that decision through an accelerated review process.\n\n## Why?\nThe vacation of this street portion was previously approved by the City Council on September 22, 2020. No protests were filed against the vacation at that time, and all conditions imposed by the Council have been fulfilled. The current action is simply finalizing and formalizing what was already approved five years ago, as instructed by the City Council. The resolution has been reviewed and approved by the City Attorney for form and legality.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** Portion of McKinley Place south of 87th Street, Council District 9\n- **Case Number:** VAC – E1401340\n- **Original Approval:** September 22, 2020\n- **Environmental Status:** The project is exempt from California Environmental Quality Act requirements under categorical exemptions (Class 5(3))\n- **Charter Compliance:** The action complies with Section 556 of the Los Angeles City Charter\n\n## Impact\nAdopting this resolution formally removes this street portion from public right-of-way. This allows the affected property owners or developers to use the vacated street area for private purposes. The lack of protests when originally proposed suggests minimal community opposition.",

      "summary": "# Summary: McKinley Place Street Vacation (File 11-0122-S3)\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\nThe Los Angeles City Council is being asked to approve the vacation (removal from public ownership) of a 32.5-foot by 135-foot portion of McKinley Place, located southerly of 87th Street. This means the City would give up its ownership and maintenance responsibilities for this small section of street, and it would likely become private property or be incorporated into an adjacent property.\n\n## Why?\nThe City identifies several benefits to this vacation. Most importantly, it would eliminate the City's ongoing obligation to maintain this portion of street and remove the City's potential liability from owning the easement. The vacation is determined to be unnecessary for current or future public use and is not needed for non-motorized transportation (like bike paths). The petitioner (the property owner requesting the vacation) has already paid a $14,980 deposit to cover investigation costs.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Location:** Portion of McKinley Place south of 87th Street (Lot 12 of Tract 473)\n- **Committee Vote:** Unanimously approved (5-0) on August 19, 2020\n- **CEQA Status:** Exempt from environmental review\n- **Petitioner Costs:** Already paid $14,980; may owe additional fees for deficit costs\n\n## Impact\nThis primarily affects the property owner adjacent to the street section, who would gain access to this land. Los Angeles residents would see a minor reduction in publicly maintained street. The City saves on maintenance costs and liability exposure. The document notes no community impact statement was submitted, suggesting minimal public concern was raised.",

This vacation is being considered as part of a transit priority development project in the area.\n\n## Why?\nThe alley vacation is intended to support a transit priority development project that would benefit the community.

The proposed vacation area is approximately 4,387.3 square feet and is situated between McKinley Avenue & McKinley Place and 87th Street and 87th Place.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe vacation is being requested to enable the development of a neighborhood park on the currently vacant and asphalt-paved parcel. The project will convert an underutilized public right of way into a community green space, approximately half an acre in size. The vacation is being pursued in conjunction with a B-Permit (BR 003792).\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Project Manager/Petitioner:** George Baliteria, North East Trees, 570 West Avenue 26, Suite 200, Los Angeles, CA 90065\n- **Property Owner:** City of Los Angeles, with signatory Shelley Luce (President & CEO)\n- **Size:** Approximately 4,387.3 square feet\n- **Location:** Central Engineering District, Council District 9, District Map Nos. 096 A 207 & 097 SA 207\n- **Application Date:** March 29, 2018\n\n## Impact\n\nThis project will benefit the local community by transforming an underutilized asphalt-covered area into accessible green space. The vacation is small enough (under 10,000 sq. ft.) to potentially qualify for categorical exemption from California Environmental Quality Act review, though residents should note that city agencies like LADOT may require additional fees for referral and investigation.",

Once vacated, this street segment would be transferred to the adjacent private property owner, North East Trees (representing Heal the Bay), to create a neighborhood park instead of maintaining it as a public street.\n\n## Why?\nThe street segment is underutilized and not essential for public circulation. The petitioner plans to develop the vacated area into a community park featuring shade trees, gardens, fitness stations, a walking track, and outdoor classrooms to serve students at Wisdom Academy for Young Scientists (WAYS) and the surrounding South Los Angeles community.

The vacated street would be transferred to North East Trees, representing Heal the Bay, which is the current lessee of the adjoining property.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe petitioner wants to convert the underutilized street into a neighborhood park that will serve Wisdom Academy for Young Scientists (WAYS) students and the surrounding community. The proposed improvements include shade trees, a garden, fitness stations, a walking track, and outdoor classrooms. The City would benefit by being relieved of ongoing street maintenance obligations and potential liability associated with owning the street easement.\n\n## Key Details\n\nThe application was submitted on March 29, 2018, and the City Council initiated vacation proceedings in February 2019. The petitioner has already paid $14,980 in investigation fees. The vacation was found to be consistent with the City's General Plan and the Southeast Los Angeles Community Plan's goals for open space and recreation. No objections were received from the public, and city departments—including the Fire Department, Planning Department, and Department of Transportation—approved the request with conditions.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe vacation will require the petitioner to dedicate additional street width to McKinley Avenue and construct significant improvements to adjacent streets (McKinley Place, 87th Street, and McKinley Avenue), including new sidewalks, curbs, gutters, and curb ramps. A 2-year timeline has been set for the petitioner to complete all conditions. Once vacated, the street area becomes private property for the community park project, benefiting local residents while removing city maintenance responsibilities.",

      "summary": "# Summary of Council File 11-0122-S3\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nThis document presents a vacation (closure) of a portion of McKinley Place, specifically the section southerly of 87th Street in Los Angeles. The vacation boundary is shown on the attached map, which identifies the specific streets and parcels involved in this public right-of-way closure action.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe document indicates this is a preliminary proposal subject to change. While the specific rationale is not detailed in the visible portions of this map exhibit, street vacations are typically pursued when property owners or the City determine that a street segment is no longer needed for public use, or when consolidating parcels would serve community interests better than maintaining the existing street configuration.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Location:** McKinley Place, southerly of 87th Street, Los Angeles\n- **Work Order:** VAC-E1401340\n- **Engineering District:** Central (T.G. 704-E3)\n- **District Map:** 096A207\n- **Council District:** 3\n- **Date Reference:** December 26, 1906 (historical boundary establishment); Map dated 02-20-2020\n- **Issuing Agency:** City of Los Angeles Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering\n\n## Impact\n\nThis vacation would remove public access to the affected portion of McKinley Place. Property owners adjacent to the vacated segment would typically gain use of that land, while the public would lose access rights to that route. Residents in the area and stakeholders with properties bordering McKinley Place would be directly affected by this change.",

The sender, Korie Schmidt from The SEO Doctors, is writing to the City Clerk to inquire about council actions related to \"vacations of streets.\"\n\n## Why?\nThe communication appears to be a public inquiry or comment on street vacation matters pending before the city council. Street vacations typically involve the formal abandonment or closure of public streets, which requires city council approval. The sender is seeking clarification on what actions are being taken on these three file numbers.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Date:** February 6, 2019\n- **Items:** Three related council items (12, 13, and 14)\n- **File Numbers:** 11-0122-S3, 18-0194, and 18-1147\n- **Sender:** Korie Schmidt, The SEO Doctors\n- **Contact:** (310) 600-2278\n\n## Impact\nThis is a brief public inquiry rather than a formal proposal with direct impacts. The communication serves as public participation in the council process, potentially representing constituents' interests in street vacation decisions that could affect land use, property access, or neighborhood infrastructure in Los Angeles.",

This is the first step in a formal legal process that would allow the currently paved, vacant street to be converted into a neighborhood park on approximately half an acre of land.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe petitioner, North East Trees (representing Heal The Bay), submitted this request to transform underutilized public right-of-way into green space for community benefit. The street vacation process is governed by California Streets and Highways Code and requires investigation of feasibility before proceeding to a public hearing and City Council vote.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Filing Date:** March 29, 2018\n- **Case Number:** VAC E1401340\n- **Location:** McKinley Place south of 87th Street (Council District 9)\n- **Petitioner Fee:** $14,980.00 paid for investigation costs\n- **Proposed Size:** Approximately ½ acre\n- **Current Condition:** Vacant and paved with asphalt\n\n## Impact & Next Steps\n\nThis report does not approve the vacation—it merely initiates the investigation process. The Bureau of Engineering will study feasibility, present findings to the Public Works and Gang Reduction Committee, and eventually schedule a public hearing before the City Council makes a final decision. Residents and stakeholders will have opportunity to comment during that public hearing phase.",

      "summary": "# Summary: Application for Vacation of Public Right of Way\n\n## What is Being Proposed?\n\nNorth East Trees, represented by Project Manager George Baliteria, is applying to vacate a public right of way at McKinley Place @ 87th Street in Los Angeles (Council District 9). The vacation area encompasses approximately 4,387.3 square feet of public street between McKinley Avenue and McKinley Place, and between 87th Street and 87th Place.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe purpose of vacating this public right of way is to develop the currently vacant, asphalt-paved area into a neighborhood park. The project will convert approximately half an acre of underutilized public space into green space for community use. This vacation is being pursued in conjunction with a B-Permit (BR 003792).\n\n## Key Details\n\n- **Applicant/Owner**: City of Los Angeles through Heal the Bay organization (President & CEO: Shelley Luce), located in Santa Monica\n- **Contact**: George Baliteria, 570 West Avenue 26, Suite 200, Los Angeles, CA 90065; (951) 201-2710\n- **Location**: McKinley Place @ 87th Street; Central Engineering District\n- **Size**: 4,387.3 square feet\n- **Application Date**: March 24, 2018 (received March 30, 2018)\n\n## Impact\n\nSince the vacation area is under 10,000 square feet, it qualifies for categorical exemption from California Environmental Quality Act review, reducing processing time and costs. The City of Los Angeles, through Heal the Bay, will benefit from expanded public park space, while the community gains improved neighborhood amenities and green space access.",
