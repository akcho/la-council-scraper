  "summary": "**KEY DECISIONS**\n- Passed updated rent stabilization ordinance (RSO) formula with 90% of CPI (Consumer Price Index), 1% floor, 4% ceiling (passed 12-2)\n- Approved resolution opposing the Dodger Stadium gondola project, urging Metro to reject the environmental impact report (passed 11-2)\n- Authorized $9 million state HomeKey grant for LA Housing Authority to create 28 supportive housing units in Koreatown\n\n**NOTABLE DISCUSSIONS**\n- Extensive debate on rent control formula, with failed amendments for 75% CPI and rent banking provisions\n- Housing department study showed RSO property values doubled from $150,000 to $300,000 per unit over 10 years, while landlords remain profitable despite rising costs\n- Strong opposition to gondola project from Chinatown residents and council members representing affected districts\n\n**BOTTOM LINE**\nAfter 40 years, the council updated LA's rent increase formula to provide more tenant protections while maintaining incentives for housing providers. The new formula reduces allowable annual rent increases from the previous system while still allowing adjustments for inflation, affecting nearly 650,000 rent-stabilized units citywide.",
