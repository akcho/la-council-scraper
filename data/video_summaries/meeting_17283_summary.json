  "summary": "This was mostly a ceremonial meeting with some routine business, but there was one major policy decision:\n\n## KEY DECISIONS\n\n• **Rent Control Formula Updated**: Council passed changes to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) formula after extensive debate, using 90% of CPI (Consumer Price Index) with a 1% floor and 4% ceiling for annual rent increases\n• **Gondola Opposition**: Council approved a resolution opposing Frank McCourt's proposed gondola project from Union Station to Dodger Stadium (11-2 vote)\n\n## NOTABLE DISCUSSIONS  \n\n• **RSO Debate Dominated Meeting**: Hours of heated discussion between tenant advocates pushing for lower rent increases (some wanted 60-75% of CPI) versus landlords arguing current costs exceed proposed caps\n• **Housing Crisis Context**: Multiple speakers cited LA's affordability crisis, with 300,000 eviction notices filed in recent years, mostly for non-payment of rent\n\n## BOTTOM LINE\n\nAfter 40+ years, LA finally updated its rent control formula to be more tenant-friendly, though not as restrictive as some advocates wanted. The 90% CPI compromise was designed to get enough votes to pass while still providing some relief to renters facing steep annual increases.\n\nThe rest was routine business including settlement approvals and ceremonial items like honoring environmental advocates Jesse Marquez and Melanie Winter who recently passed away.",
