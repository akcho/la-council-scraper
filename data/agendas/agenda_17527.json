no immediate fiscal impact to the General Fund in 2025-26 as a result of the recommendations in the report. The consolidation of the DOA, EWDD, and YDD into the CIFD, to be renamed CID, would result in the elimination of 21 positions and the addition of five new positions. This will result in an annual savings of $3.52 million, consisting of $0.78 million in General Fund and $2.74 million in Special Funds. Additionally, lease and operating expense reductions will generate $1,832,905 ($914,281 General Fund and $918,624 Special Fund) in savings if the CIFD, EWDD, LADOA, and YDD are consolidated and co-located at a City-owned site such as the Mangrove property. These savings may be reduced by operational and maintenance costs at a new location as well as one-time costs such as those associated with relocating employees between worksites, modifying informational technology systems, staff time to support the transition, and employee payouts. The anticipated savings and the total cost to implement the consolidation depend on the effective date of the consolidation. The 2025-26 Unappropriated Balance provides $630,000 for the Community Investment for Families Department to enhance the efficiency of community services programs Citywide. These funds were intended for costs associated with the proposed consolidation. Other potential benefits such as reduced contract execution timelines for service providers, expedited processing and payment of invoices cannot be quantified at this time.\nFinancial Policies Statement:\nThe CAO and CLA report that the recommendations in the report comply with the City's Financial Policies as they support the City's goal to achieve and maintain a structurally balanced budget in which future costs are projected to be fully paid by future revenues.\nCommunity Impact Statement:\nNone submitted\nGovernment Efficiency, Innovation, and Audits Committee Report 12-5-25\nCommittee Recommendations for Action Presented in Committee 12-5-25\nReport from Civil Rights, Equity, Immigration, Aging, and Disability Committee_11-7-25\nReport from Economic Development and Jobs Committee_11-7-25\nCommunication from CAO and CLA 12-04-25 - Presentation\nJoint Report from City Administrative Officer and Chief Legislative Analyst dated 12-02-25\nTransmittal Letter to Government Efficiency, Innovation, and Audits Committee_2_11-7-25\nCommunication from City Administrative Officer - Amendment_11-7-25\nCommunication from City Administrative Officer - Presentation_11-7-25\nCommunication(s) from Public_11-07-2025\nCommunication(s) from Public_11-06-2025\nJoint Report from City Administrative Officer and Chief Legislative Analyst dated 10-22-25\nCommunication from Community Investment for Families Department dated 8-19-25 - Presentation\nCommunication(s) from Public_08-19-2025\nSpeaker Card(s)_08-19-2025\nReport from Community Investment for Families Department dated 7-25-25",

These savings may be reduced by operational and maintenance costs at a new location as well as one-time costs such as those associated with relocating employees between worksites, modifying informational technology systems, staff time to support the transition, and employee payouts. The anticipated savings and the total cost to implement the consolidation depend on the effective date of the consolidation. The 2025-26 Unappropriated Balance provides $630,000 for the Community Investment for Families Department to enhance the efficiency of community services programs Citywide. These funds were intended for costs associated with the proposed consolidation. Other potential benefits such as reduced contract execution timelines for service providers, expedited processing and payment of invoices cannot be quantified at this time. Financial Policies Statement: The CAO and CLA report that the recommendations in the report comply with the City's Financial Policies as they support the City's goal to achieve and maintain a structurally balanced budget in which future costs are projected to be fully paid by future revenues.

hearing is not held in Committee, an opportunity for public comment will be provided.)\n(Please visit\nwww.lacouncilfile.com\nfor background documents.)\nFiscal Impact Statement:\nThe CAO reports that the recommendations stated in the November 13, 2025 CAO report, attached to the Council File, include transfers, appropriations, and authority for expenditures totaling $7.4 million. This consists of $2.3 million from various special funds, $4.2 million in MICLA funds, and $0.86 million in CTIEP funds.  All transfers and appropriations are based on existing funds, reimbursements, or revenues.  There is an unanticipated General Fund impact in an amount not yet determined for operations and maintenance costs of two facilities currently not in operation, Barnsdall Art Park - Residence A and Engine Company 23 Youth Arts Center.  These costs will be addressed through the City budget process at the time the facilities are scheduled for completion.\nFinancial Policies Statement:\nThe CAO reports that the recommendations stated in the November 13, 2025 CAO report, attached to the Council File, comply with the City’s Financial Policies in that appropriations for funds are limited to available cash balances needed to fund ongoing maintenance, programming, project shortfalls, and critical operational needs in the current budget year.\nDebt Impact Statement:\nThe CAO reports that the issuance of MICLA debt is a General Fund obligation.  The proposed MICLA fund appropriation for the capital project described in the November 13, 2025 CAO report, attached to the Council (Item E - ITA Server Room Upgrade Phase II) would cause the City to borrow $1.2 million at an approximate 5.5 percent interest rate over a period of 20 years.  The total estimated debt service for the MICLA-funded projects is $2.0 million, including interest of approximately $0.8 million.  The estimated average annual debt service is $96,000 over a period of 20 years.  Actual interest rates may differ as rates are dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance.  The CAO cannot fully predict what interest rates will be in the future.  In accordance with the City's Debt Management Policy, the City has an established debt ceiling to guide the evaluation of the affordability for future debt. The debt ceiling for non-voted direct debt as a percentage of General Fund revenues is six percent. The 2025-26 Adopted Budget non-voter-approved debt service ratio is 2.40 percent. The issuance of MICLA debt for these projects will not cause the City to exceed the six percent non-voter-approved debt limit.\nCommunity Impact Statement:\nNone submitted.\nGovernment Operations Committee Report 12-2-25\nTransmittal Letter_12-2-25\nAmendment Submitted In GO Committee Meeting_12-2-25\nReport from City Administrative Officer dated  11-13-25",
