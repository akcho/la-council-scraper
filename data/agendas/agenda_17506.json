This consists of $4.9 million from various special funds, $23.4 million in MICLA funds, $2.2 million in Capital and Technology Improvement Expenditure Program (CTIEP) funds, and $1.4 million in General Fund. All transfers and appropriations are based on existing funds, reimbursements, or revenues.

The total estimated debt service for the MICLA-funded projects is $3.3 million, including interest of approximately $1.3 million. The estimated average annual debt service is $167,000 over a period of 20 years. Actual interest rates may differ as rates are dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance.

The debt ceiling for non-voted direct debt as a percentage of General Fund revenues is six percent. The 2025-26 Adopted Budget non-voter-approved debt service ratio is 2.40 percent.

Granted the appeal in part and found that the Department of Building and Safety (DBS) erred in preparing to issue Supplemental Building Permit No. 24026-10000-00086 because compliance with Performance Standard Nos. 3, 4 and 5, pursuant under LAMC Chapter 1, Section 14.00 A.7(a)(3), (4) and (5), was prematurely cleared. Recommended the DBS not issue a use of land building permit for a new recreational vehicle park as a Public Benefit Project until all of the required performance standards under LAMC, Chapter 1, Section 14.00 A.7(a)(1) through (12) have been satisfied or a Conditional Use Permit has been approved and that any project plans submitted be consistent with those cleared by the Department of City Planning.

This consists of $13.2 million from various special funds, $4.6 million in MICLA, $3.1 million in Grant Funds, and $0.3 million in General Fund within the Capital and Technology Improvement Expenditure Program (CTIEP) program. All transfers and appropriations are based on existing funds, reimbursements, or revenues. There is a potential impact on the General Fund for operations and maintenance costs, with the amount yet to be determined. These costs will be addressed through the City budget process as projects are completed.\nFinancial Policies Statement:\nThe CAO also reports that the recommendations stated in this report comply with the City Financial Policies in that appropriations for funds are limited to available cash balances needed to fund ongoing maintenance, programming, project shortfalls, and critical operational needs in the current budget year.\nDebt Impact Statement:\nThe CAO further reports that the issuance of MICLA debt is a General Fund obligation. The reauthorization of MICLA funding for the Shell ReCharge Project Closeout (Item X) would cause the City to borrow $1.2 million at an approximate 5.5 percent interest rate over a period of 20 years. The total estimated debt service for the MICLA-funded projects is $2.0 million, including interest of approximately $0.8 million. The estimated average annual debt service is $99,000 over a period of 20 years.\nActual interest rates may differ as rates are dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance. We cannot fully predict what interest rates will be in the future. In accordance with the City's Debt Management Policy, the City has an established debt ceiling to guide the evaluation of the affordability for future debt. The debt ceiling for non-voted direct debt as a percentage of General Fund revenues is six percent. The 2025-26 Adopted Budget non-voter-approved debt service ratio is 2.40 percent.

FY: 2019-20, Fund: 298/38, Account: 38SEVC, Electric Vehicle Chargers, Amount: $62,997. FY: 2021-22, Fund: 298/40, Account: 40V25F, Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure, Amount: $687,468. AUTHORIZE the CAO to make technical corrections, as necessary, to the transactions authorized through this report, as required to implement the intent of those transactions. Fiscal Impact Statement: The CAO reports that the recommendations stated in this report include transfers, appropriations, and authority for expenditures totaling $21.2 million. This consists of $13.2 million from various special funds, $4.6 million in MICLA, $3.1 million in Grant Funds, and $0.3 million in General Fund within the Capital and Technology Improvement Expenditure Program (CTIEP) program. All transfers and appropriations are based on existing funds, reimbursements, or revenues. There is a potential impact on the General Fund for operations and maintenance costs, with the amount yet to be determined. These costs will be addressed through the City budget process as projects are completed. Financial Policies Statement: The CAO also reports that the recommendations stated in this report comply with the City Financial Policies in that appropriations for funds are limited to available cash balances needed to fund ongoing maintenance, programming, project shortfalls, and critical operational needs in the current budget year. Debt Impact Statement: The CAO further reports that the issuance of MICLA debt is a General Fund obligation. The reauthorization of MICLA funding for the Shell ReCharge Project Closeout (Item X) would cause the City to borrow $1.2 million at an approximate 5.5 percent interest rate over a period of 20 years. The total estimated debt service for the MICLA-funded projects is $2.0 million, including interest of approximately $0.8 million. The estimated average annual debt service is $99,000 over a period of 20 years. Actual interest rates may differ as rates are dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance. We cannot fully predict what interest rates will be in the future. In accordance with the City's Debt Management Policy, the City has an established debt ceiling to guide the evaluation of the affordability for future debt. The debt ceiling for non-voted direct debt as a percentage of General Fund revenues is six percent. The 2025-26 Adopted Budget non-voter-approved debt service ratio is 2.40 percent. The issuance of MICLA debt for these projects will not cause the City to exceed the six percent non-voter-approved debt limit. Community Impact Statement: None submitted.

BUDGET AND FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT Recommendations for Council action, SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MAYOR: APPROVE the CAO report dated October 2, 2025, attached to Council file No. 25-0006-S57. REQUEST the City Attorney to revise the draft Ordinance dated June 20, 2025 to align with the Mayor’s revised Executive Order dated April 25, 2025, to waive all building permit fees associated with repair or reconstruction of single family structures and duplexes, damaged or destroyed up to 110 percent of the original structure as a result of the Wildfires of January 2025. APPROVE the following recommendations contained in the CAO report dated May 7, 2025 as Recommendation No. 1.b-e, attached to Council file No. 25-0006-S57: Find that the waiving of permit and plan check fees for rebuilding properties represents a clear public benefit inasmuch as the waivers would remove barriers to reconstruction and benefit the economy of the City. Request the Controller to establish a new account Wildfire Emergency Permit Fee Waivers in the General City Purposes (GCP) and appropriate $10 million from a temporary revolving loan from the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety’s (LADBS) Building Permit Enterprise Fund (Enterprise Fund) to be repaid, with interest, by General Fund dollars. Instruct the LADBS to establish fee waiver procedures, including the process for obtaining reimbursements of waived fees from GCP to ensure full cost recovery for the Enterprise Fund. Instruct the CAO to identify General Fund dollars to repay the Enterprise Fund, for any and all fees waived in connection with the January 2025 Wildfires, with interest calculated at the City Daily Interest Pool Rate. INSTRUCT the CAO to report on the following: A breakdown of the cost estimate, including the specific fees waived, not waived and the estimated amount for each. The payment structures and how that could be limited or predictable on an annual basis. Adding a provision in the report on whether this fee waiver could be time limited to four or five years. Fiscal Impact Statement: The CAO reports that should the City waive plan check and permit fees related to the repairs and rebuilding of structures that were damaged or destroyed during the January 2025 Wildfires, based on the current daft ordinance, the General Fund impact could be as high as $278.35 million, not including the costs of borrowing. Financial Policies Statement: The CAO reports that should the City waive plan check and permit fees related to the repairs and rebuilding of structures that were damaged or destroyed during the January 2025 Wildfires, based on the current daft ordinance, the General Fund impact could be as high as $278.35 million, not including the costs of borrowing.
