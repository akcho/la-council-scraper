# Auto-Start Instructions

When starting a new Claude Code session:

1. Read `docs/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md` to understand the current state
2. Check the "Current Focus" section for immediate next steps
3. Begin working on those tasks without asking for permission
4. If the next step is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions

This allows you to pick up exactly where we left off in the previous session.
